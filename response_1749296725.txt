ü§ñ Answer: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants me to explain the difference between mobile malware and mobile spyware with three real examples from the provided sources.

First, I need to recall the definitions from the context. From Source 1, malware is a generic term that includes viruses, Trojans, spyware, etc., which harm computing systems. It mentions that malware has evolved from simple annoyances to complex code for profit or espionage. Spyware specifically is mentioned as part of malware, but I need to check if there's more detail.

Looking at Source 2, it defines malware as malicious software including spyware, Trojan horses, viruses, and worms. Mobile spyware isn't explicitly defined here, but since spyware is a subset of malware, the distinction might be in their specific functions. Malware is broader, while spyware focuses on monitoring and collecting data without consent.

Now, examples. The user wants three real examples from the books. From Source 1, there's mention of Trojan horses that capture keystrokes and send info to malicious hosts. That could be an example of malware (Trojan) which might also be spyware if it's about surveillance. Also, viruses that replicate by inserting into other programs. Another example could be ransomware from Source 2, which encrypts data and demands payment. However, the user asked for three examples. Wait, but the sources don't explicitly list real-world examples like specific names (e.g., Zeus, SpyEye), but rather describe types.

So maybe the answer should use the classifications provided. For example:

1. Trojan Horse: As described in Source 1, which embeds malicious code in legitimate apps to capture keystrokes and send data. This is malware and could be considered spyware if it's about surveillance.

2. Virus: From Source 1, a virus replicates by inserting into other programs, needing a host to cause harm. This is malware but not specifically spyware.

3. Ransomware: From Source 2, which locks devices or encrypts data and demands payment. This is malware but not spyware.

Wait, but the user wants examples that differentiate between mobile malware (broader category) and mobile spyware (subset). So perhaps:

- Malware Example: Trojan Horse (Source 1)
- Spyware Example: The part where malware monitors and exfiltrates user location data through compromised sensors (Source 1 mentions this as a threat from advanced devices)
- Another example could be viruses, but maybe the third example is ransomware. However, need to check if spyware is explicitly mentioned.

Wait, Source 1 says "malware... encompasses viruses, Trojans, spywares..." So spyware is a type of malware. Therefore, examples would include:

Mobile Malware (general): Trojan Horse (Source 1), Virus (Source 1), Ransomware (Source 2)

Mobile Spyware: The part where malware monitors user data and location through sensors (Source 1). Also, maybe the keystroke capturing by Trojans is spyware as well.

So three examples could be:

1. Trojan Horse (malware) that captures keystrokes [Source 1]
2. Virus (malware) that replicates via other programs [Source 1]
3. Spyware that monitors and exfiltrates private data through compromised sensors [Source 1]

But the user asked for three examples from the book, so maybe using the specific terms mentioned in the sources.

Mobile malware refers to a broad category of malicious software designed to harm devices or systems, while mobile spyware is a subset focused on covertly monitoring and collecting user data without consent. Here are three examples from the context:

1. **Trojan Horse (Malware)**: A type of malware embedded in legitimate applications or systems, which appears to perform useful functions but secretly captures user keystrokes and sends sensitive information to malicious hosts [Source 1].

2. **Virus (Malware)**: Code that replicates by inserting itself into other programs, requiring a host program to cause harm, such as corrupting system files or compromising devices [Source 1].

3. **Spyware (Subset of Malware)**: Malicious software that monitors and exfiltrates private user data, such as location information, through compromised sensors on advanced mobile devices [Source 1]. 

These examples highlight the distinction between general malware (e.g., Trojans, viruses) and spyware, which specifically targets surveillance and data theft.
