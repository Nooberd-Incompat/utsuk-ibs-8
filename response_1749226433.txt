ðŸ“‹ Question: what is a chatbot?
ðŸ¤– Answer: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked, "what is a chatbot?" and I need to answer based on the provided context.

Looking at the sources given, both Source 1 and Source 2 mention Hackerbot as an IRC chatbot. Specifically, in Source 1, it says Hackerbot is an attacker chatbot used in security labs. In Source 2, there's more detail: Hackerbot is described as an IRC chatbot that interacts with students via instant messaging, presenting challenges by attacking their VMs and requiring them to defend or investigate to earn CTF flags.

So the key points here are that a chatbot, in this context, is an automated program that communicates through text-based interfaces. The examples given are Hackerbot, which operates on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and uses IM clients like Pidgin. It's used for educational purposes in cybersecurity labs to simulate attacks and challenges.

I should make sure not to add any external knowledge. The context doesn't mention other types of chatbots beyond Hackerbot, so the answer should focus on what's provided. Also, need to cite the sources properly. Since both chunks mention Hackerbot as a chatbot, but Source 2 gives more specific details about its function and interaction method.

Wait, the question is general ("what is a chatbot?") but the context only discusses Hackerbot as an example. So the answer should define a chatbot based on the information given in the sources, using Hackerbot as an example. The user might be expecting a general definition, but since the context doesn't provide a broad definition beyond Hackerbot, I need to stick to what's there.

Therefore, the answer would state that a chatbot is an automated program that interacts with users through text-based interfaces, such as IRC or IM clients, and in this case, Hackerbot is used for cybersecurity education. Cite Source 2 for the specific example of Hackerbot's functionality.

A chatbot is an automated program designed to interact with users through text-based interfaces. In the context of the provided material, **Hackerbot** serves as an example of a chatbot, specifically an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot that communicates via instant messaging (IM) to engage students in cybersecurity challenges. It presents tasks such as defending against simulated attacks or investigating security incidents, rewarding successful completion with Capture the Flag (CTF) flags [Source 2: hackerbot-attacker-chatbots-for-randomised-and-interactive.pdf].
