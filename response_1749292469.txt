ðŸ“‹ Question: In all the books weâ€™ve discussed so far, which authors emphasize zero-trust or â€˜never trust, always verifyâ€™ approaches for mobileÂ devices?
ðŸ¤– Answer: Unfortunately, none of the mentioned sources (Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 2; Georgios Kambourakis et al.'s book on Intrusion Detection and Prevention for Mobile Ecosystems) explicitly emphasize a "zero-trust" or 'never trust, always verify' approach for mobile devices. The provided context does not mention anything specific about zero-trust or this particular security approach in the context of mobile devices.

However, I can provide some general information on the concept of zero-trust and its relevance to mobile devices. Zero-trust is a security model that assumes all networks and devices are untrusted, and therefore requires constant verification and validation before access is granted (Source: NIST Special Publication 800-212: "Zero Trust Architecture" [NIST SP 800-212: Zero Trust Architecture]). While this approach can be applied to mobile devices, it's not explicitly emphasized in the provided context.

The provided context mainly discusses blockchain, digital finance, and inclusion, as well as intrusion detection and prevention for mobile ecosystems. It does mention security issues and technological developments that introduce the future of finance (Source: Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 2). However, it doesn't specifically address zero-trust or 'never trust, always verify' approaches for mobile devices.
