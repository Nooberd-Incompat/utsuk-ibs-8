ðŸ“‹ Question: Can you explain what NFC (Near Field Communication) is and how it's used in mobile payments?
ðŸ¤– Answer: I couldn't find any information about NFC or its use in mobile payments within the provided context. The conversation history only mentions a query related to NFC, but since I couldn't locate any mention of NFC in the initial text snippet, I must conclude that there is insufficient information in this context to answer your question accurately.

If you could provide more context or clarify what aspects of NFC or its use in mobile payments you'd like me to address, I'll be happy to help.
