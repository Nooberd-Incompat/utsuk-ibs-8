ðŸ“‹ Question: I came across 'Gai, Keke' and his book on mobile cloud computing â€” does he mention real-world implementation issues in secure communication?
ðŸ¤– Answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about real-world implementation issues in secure communication mentioned by Gai, Keke, in their book on "Mobile Cloud Computing Models, Implementation, and Security" (2017) within the provided context. However, according to Chapter 205 of the same book, they mention Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Transport layer security (TLS), and Tree topology as relevant topics in mobile cloud computing.

It is possible that Gai, Keke discuss real-world implementation issues in secure communication in their book, but without further information or context, I couldn't provide a specific answer to your question.
