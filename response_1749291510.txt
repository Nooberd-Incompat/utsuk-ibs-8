ðŸ“‹ Question: Which cryptographic protocols are used in NFC-based mobile transactions, and how do they protect against eavesdropping?
ðŸ¤– Answer: I can provide an answer to your question based on the given context.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about NFC or its use in mobile payments within the provided context. However, I can tell you that the context does mention "mobile devices" and "mobile ecosystem," which suggests that it may be related to mobile transactions or security.

If you'd like, I can try to provide more general information on cryptographic protocols used in mobile transactions or intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for mobile ecosystems. Please let me know how I can assist you further.
