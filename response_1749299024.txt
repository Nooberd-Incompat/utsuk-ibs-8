üìã Question: What is buffer overflow in mobile security?
ü§ñ Answer: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about buffer overflow in mobile security. I need to check the provided context for any mentions of buffer overflow or related concepts.

Looking at Source 1: It talks about iOS app vetting processes and security measures, but nothing about buffer overflows. 

Source 2: Discusses privilege escalation exploits and attack scenarios like denial-of-service and relay attacks. Still no mention of buffer overflows.

Source 3: Mentions security gaps in complex systems and malicious programs targeting mobile phones. Again, no specific reference to buffer overflow.

None of the sources explicitly discuss buffer overflow. The context covers app vetting, privilege escalation, secure element attacks, but not buffer overflow. Since the user's question isn't addressed in the provided materials, I should inform them that there's insufficient information in the context to answer their query about buffer overflow in mobile security.

The provided context does not contain sufficient information to explain "buffer overflow in mobile security." The sources discuss topics such as app vetting processes, privilege escalation exploits, secure element attacks, and denial-of-service scenarios but do not mention buffer overflows or related technical details. For a detailed explanation, additional resources would be required.
