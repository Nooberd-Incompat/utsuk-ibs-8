üìã Question: Which cryptographic protocols are used in NFC-based mobile transactions, and how do they protect against eavesdropping?
ü§ñ Answer: <think>
Okay, the user is asking about the cryptographic protocols used in NFC-based mobile transactions and how they protect against eavesdropping. Let me check the provided sources to find relevant information.

Looking at Source 1, it discusses security issues in NFC devices and mentions use cases in automotive environments. However, it doesn't specifically detail cryptographic protocols or their role in protecting against eavesdropping. The focus here is more on attack scenarios and security requirements rather than the specific protocols used.

Now, checking Source 2, which talks about mobile payments using NFC. It describes the communication process involving Secure Elements (SE) and Host Card Emulation (HCE). While it explains the components involved in transactions, like the SE communicating with the NFC controller and the TSM, there's no explicit mention of cryptographic protocols such as AES or RSA. The text does note that HCE uses software-based emulation without a secure element, but again, specific protocols aren't named.

Since neither source explicitly lists cryptographic protocols used in NFC transactions, I need to inform the user that the provided context doesn't contain enough information on this topic. However, I can mention the security measures discussed in Source 1, such as attack scenarios and security requirements, even though they don't specify the protocols themselves.

The provided context does not explicitly detail the cryptographic protocols used in NFC-based mobile transactions or their specific mechanisms for protecting against eavesdropping. However, it does discuss general security features of NFC devices, such as the use of secure elements (SE) and host card emulation (HCE) in mobile payment systems [Source 2: David Lee Kuo Chuen, Robert H. Deng - Handbook of Blockchain, Digital Finance, and Inclusion, Volume 2_ ChinaTech, Mobile Security, and Distributed Ledger. 2-Academic Press (2018).pdf]. These components are implied to handle secure communication, but specific protocols (e.g., AES, RSA) or encryption methods are not mentioned in the given context. For a detailed analysis of cryptographic protocols in NFC transactions, further technical specifications would be required.
