ðŸ“‹ Question: i was asking about Internnet Relay Chat
ðŸ¤– Answer: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user asked about Internet Relay Chat (IRC). I need to check the provided sources for any mention of IRC.

Looking at Source 1: It talks about Hackerbot using AIML chatbot rules and Metasploit exploits, but no mention of IRC.

Source 2: Discusses web application security, session variables, and debug messages. No IRC here either.

Source 3: The chunk shows an FTP example with IP addresses and credentials, but again, nothing about IRC.

Hmm, none of the sources mention IRC or Internet Relay Chat. The user might have confused IRC with something else mentioned, like AIML chatbots or network monitoring, but there's no direct info on IRC in the provided context. I should inform them that the sources don't cover IRC.

The context provided does not mention "Internet Relay Chat" (IRC) or related concepts. The documents focus on topics such as chatbot configurations, Metasploit exploits, session variables in web applications, and network security challenges, but none discuss IRC specifically [Source 1: hackerbot-attacker-chatbots-for-randomised-and-interactive.pdf; Source 2: The Web Application Hacker's Handbook; Source 3: Hacking the art of Exploitation].
