ðŸ“‹ Question: what is web application security?
ðŸ¤– Answer: <think>
Okay, the user is asking about web application security. Let me look through the provided sources to find relevant information.

Starting with Source 1: The History of Software Security (1).pdf, Chunk 7. It mentions "Web Application Reconnaissance" and talks about offense and defense in the context of securing modern web apps. There's a discussion about friction between DevOps and Security teams, but it doesn't directly define web application security.

Moving to Source 2: Tony UcedaVelez and Marco M. Morana's book on Risk Centric Threat Modeling. Chunk 347 discusses threat modeling as a risk-focused process integrating with information security. It talks about analyzing threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, architecture, software components, and assets like confidential data. This seems relevant. The term "software security centric" and "asset security centric" approaches are mentioned here.

Source 3 is the same book but another chunk. However, the content provided in Source 2 already covers aspects of web application security risks, including the need for comprehensive analysis considering threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, architecture, components, and assets. It also mentions PASTA as a methodology that's both software and asset centric.

Putting this together: Web application security involves protecting web apps from threats by analyzing vulnerabilities, attacks, and ensuring secure architecture. The sources mention threat modeling, risk assessment, and integrating with information security processes. However, none of the sources explicitly define "web application security" in a single sentence. They focus more on methods and processes rather than a definition.

The answer should explain that web application security is about protecting web apps from threats through analysis of vulnerabilities, attacks, and using methodologies like PASTA for risk-based threat modeling. Also, mention the balance between DevOps and Security teams as per Source 1. But since there's no direct definition in the sources, I need to state that based on the provided context.

The term "web application security" is not explicitly defined in the provided context. However, the documents discuss related concepts such as securing modern web applications through threat modeling, risk analysis, and addressing vulnerabilities [Source 2: Tony UcedaVelez, Marco M. Morana - Risk Centric Threat Modeling_ Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis-Wiley (2015).pdf, Chunk 347]. The context also highlights challenges in balancing security measures with development workflows, emphasizing the need to integrate security practices without obstructing DevOps processes [Source 1: Web Application Security (1).pdf, Chunk 7]. For a precise definition, additional information would be required.
