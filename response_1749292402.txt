ðŸ“‹ Question: Is there a practical example from the 'Zhang, Yan' book on wireless mesh security that explains physical-layer defense?
ðŸ¤– Answer: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about a book by Zhang, Yan on wireless mesh security. The provided conversation history does not mention this specific book or author.

However, based on general knowledge, I can provide an explanation of physical-layer security in mobile networks. Physical-layer security refers to the use of physical properties of a communication channel to prevent eavesdropping and intercepting of data transmitted over that channel. This type of security is often used in wireless communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

Examples of physical-layer security measures include:

1. Frequency Hopping: Switching between different frequencies to prevent interception.
2. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS): Spreading the signal across a wide frequency range to make it difficult to intercept.
3. Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH): Automatically switching between frequencies to evade detection by eavesdroppers.
4. Beamforming: Focusing the signal in a specific direction to reduce interference and increase security.

These measures can be used in mobile networks to secure communication channels, but they are not specifically mentioned in the provided context.

If you have any more information about the book or author, I'd be happy to try and help further.
