üìã Question: I read that ‚ÄòMichael Roland‚Äô covered NFC security in detail. Can you summarize one attack vector he discussed and its mitigation?
ü§ñ Answer: <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to answer this question. The user is asking about an attack vector discussed by Michael Roland in his work on NFC security and its mitigation.

First, I need to check the provided context sources. Let's look through the chunks given. 

Looking at Source 1: It mentions that the research focuses on security requirements for interacting with NFC tags and card emulation. It talks about identifying existing security concepts, revealing new attack scenarios, and proposing solutions. However, it doesn't specify particular attacks.

Source 2: Here, the main research questions are outlined, including unresolved security issues. The thesis discusses use cases in automotive environments and focuses on interaction with NFC tags and card emulation. It mentions evaluating protocols and designing attack models, but again, no specific attack vectors are named here either.

Source 3 is incomplete (ends with "Therefo..."), so probably not helpful.

Wait, the user's question refers to Michael Roland's work. The context provided includes chunks from his book. However, none of the chunks explicitly mention a specific attack vector. Source 1 and 2 discuss the general approach, use cases, and research methods but don't name particular attacks. 

The answer needs to be based on the given context. Since there's no explicit mention of a specific attack vector in the provided sources, I should note that the context doesn't contain enough information. But wait, maybe I missed something? Let me check again.

Looking at Source 2 again: It says "based on exemplary use-cases... investigate current security features... focus on interaction with NFC tags and card emulation... extract security requirements." Also mentions "reveal attack scenarios that are possible despite existing security concepts." However, no specific examples are given in the chunks provided. 

Therefore, since the context doesn't provide details about specific attacks or their mitigations, I should inform the user that the information isn't available in the given sources.

The provided context does not specify particular attack vectors discussed by Michael Roland in his work on NFC security, nor does it detail their corresponding mitigations. While the text outlines the focus on identifying vulnerabilities in NFC interactions with tags and card emulation, it does not name specific attacks or solutions [Source 1: Chunk 2; Source 2: Chunk 29]. For detailed examples, further sections of the referenced work would need to be consulted.
