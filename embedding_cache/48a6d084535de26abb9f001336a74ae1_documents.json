He is dead-on with many of his observations, having been working with outsourced environments myself for a number of years. I appreciate his frank observations (par  don the pun! ) and direct style in approaching the issues in other words, he calls them as he sees them. The information on the differ  ent countries, albeit somewhat lengthy, provides a great perspective as to what is going on in the world and why it is so important to know who and what country you are dealing with.

The latter section describing the controls, comments, and questions mapped to ISO27002-type requirements is very good as well. I also like the way that the book finished up with anecdotes to illustrate that these issues are real. Todd Fitzgerald Global Information Security Director Grant Thornton International, Ltd. xiii Preface Since the early 1990s, outsourcing has had a large influence on vari  ous industries in the Western world. Outsourcing companies have attracted industry giants such as Ford, GE, and Siemens, just to name a few, with promises of better expertise and significant cost savings. Now approximately 20 years later, not all of those promises have been kept. Organizations have learned their lessons outsourc  ing is not a silver bullet. Some political and economic dynamics have resulted in a shift in how outsourcing is perceived. One of the areas of concern with many outsourcing customers is the level of security and privacy of their data. Now with cloud computing becoming a standard in modern IT environments, the picture has become even fuzzier. Many security experts are raising the flag regarding security and privacy in outsourced cloud environments. This book was writ  ten with the intent to help the manager who is challenged with an outsourcing situation, whether preparing for it, living it day to day, or being tasked to safely bring back information systems to the organiza  tion. It provides guidance on how to ensure that security and privacy can be achieved during an outsourcing situation. I have worked in the consulting and outsourcing industry for more than 15 years, leading medium- to large-sized security organizations and teams.",

I have worked in the consulting and outsourcing industry for more than 15 years, leading medium- to large-sized security organizations and teams. I learned over the years that many risks can be addressed when there is a much broader understanding of a situation than just the technical aspects. xiv Preface Many factors can play into the success or failure of an outsourcing initiative. This book provides not only the technical background but also some broad information about outsourcing and its mechanics. Organizations sometimes try to resolve their issues of an expensive, fragmented IT infrastructure by looking into outsourcing. If this is truly a valid strategy, then it is heavily relying on circumstances and individual factors specific to that organization. Yet there are some common pitfalls that should be kept in mind before jumping to the conclusion that outsourcing will provide cost savings and a smootherrunning operation. One critical factor for a smooth-running IT oper  ation is a governance framework, resulting in mature processes, an executable IT strategy, and an IT environment that is maintainable. Most organizations that lack mature processes have to support an IT environment that ranges from Windows to three different UNIX fla  vors. Those environments are usually not sustainable in the long run, outsourced or not. To believe that outsourcing such an environment would result in cost savings and better performance can very quickly turn into a big disappointment. Yes, a large outsourcing company will certainly have the resources to support the various platforms and technologies. However, the more individuals an outsourcing company needs to provide to support a customer s environment, the higher the cost will be.",

    "content": "Yes, a large outsourcing company will certainly have the resources to support the various platforms and technologies. However, the more individuals an outsourcing company needs to provide to support a customer s environment, the higher the cost will be. Labor cost is the expensive part of the outsourcing equa  tion, even delivered from low-cost countries like India and China. The leading outsourcing countries in particular have a common trend: the cost of living is rising, resulting in higher labor costs, making cost savings a short-lived dream. That cost savings and security traditionally do not go hand in hand should be no surprise to anyone. Let s be clear: cost savings can be achieved in outsourcing if security is done right. However, the typi  cal large-scale outsourcing engagement does not have security as the primary objective, but cost savings. Definitions This book uses for the purpose of standardization, whenever available, the definitions set by the US National Institute for Standards (NIST). Particularly in the fast-moving market of outsourcing, companies have come up with their proprietary marketing terminology, trying xv Preface to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Looking under the  hood  of such proprietary offerings, they usually are easily tied back to the NIST definitions and standard industry terminologies. xvii Acknowledgments I thank my family, friends, and former colleagues who have helped me to create this book. 1 1 Outsourcing A precise definition of outsourcing has yet to be agreed upon. Thus, the term is used inconsistently across the industry. However, outsourcing is often viewed as involving the contracting out of a business func  tion commonly one previously performed in-house to an external provider. In this sense, two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an exchange of services and payments and it is called outsourcing.",

History of Outsourcing Nowadays there is a large number of outsourcing companies, ranging from small, employing a handful of people, to huge, employing some  times more than 200, 000 people. Whoever does business with a small outsourcing company has it easier in determining what they are dealing with than those doing business with the larger outsourcing companies. Most of them will have a large sales force that will make sure to paint the  right  picture of their services; however, it might not be a realistic picture. So what are some of the factors that can help to determine if an outsourcing company is the right one for the job? The history of a company can usually provide some pointers of its ability to operate the outsourced environment and if it has the right personnel to protect the valuable information that you entrust it with. Companies with large organic growth are usually a success story that is supported by satisfied clients and a workforce that brings the talent that you might be lack  ing in your own company. On the other hand are companies that have investors with deep pockets, supporting growth by acquisitions. This by itself is not bad; however, mergers and acquisitions are the reason that many organizations have underperformed or failed. A half-integrated   In 1997 a KPMG study referenced in The Economist (How mergers go wrong, July 20, 2000) showed that most postmerger companies underperformed.",

Due to the recent trend of insourcing, the market for outsourcing has seen smaller growth rates, resulting in takeovers and mergers. However, those new orga  nizations lack in some cases the type of management that is required to successfully integrate the two companies i. e. , to achieve synergy between the entities of the new organization. Anyone who has worked for a small company and then for one of the larger companies knows the differences: in the smaller companies that lack specialists you find the  I do it all  mentality. The larger organizations, however, have adopted the  bring in the specialist  mentality, usually achieving better results. If a small company does not change its mentality as it grows, it will not perform well internally nor be able to provide the best service to its cli  ents. Doing your research before making a decision on which company to use for outsourcing can result in a successful partnership instead of mediocre service that will cost you more in the end. Early Days of Outsourcing Outsourcing is nothing new, but it might have had a different name (outsourcing became the term for this in 1989; Mullins, 1996 ). The concept of having another company to provide services for cost sav  ings can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s. Companies started moving away from the traditional model of the large integrated com  pany that owns, manages, and directly controls its assets.",

In those years until maybe the 1990s, companies mainly used outsourcing as a tool to address skill needs that were not available within an organiza  tion. For example, publishers often used  outsourcing companies  for composition, printing, and fulfillment services. In the 1990s orga  nizations began focusing more on cost saving measures by outsourc  ing functions that were necessary to run the company but not part of the core business. As the need for cost savings has increased over the recent years, more and more processes that are critical to an organiza  tion have been outsourced. Mullins, Rick. 1996. Managing the Outsourced Enterprise. Journal of Business Strategy, 17(4): 28 36. 3 Outsourcing Current State In recent years since the late 1990s, there has been no general rule of how organizations handle outsourcing. There has been a general trend of outsourcing core processes (e. g. , human resources) to outsourcing organizations. However, other organizations did a 180-degree turn and are bringing everything back in-house, minimizing the depen  dency on third parties.

Delivery Models The outsourcing industry has developed numerous delivery models, allowing for cost savings and attracting talent for low salaries in locations that have the necessary infrastructure to run an outsourcing operation. Onshoring Onshoring is often, wrongfully, defined as an overseas investment by a domestic company (or overseas affiliate) that is subsequently rein  vested back into the domestic marketplace. In reality, onshoring has a broader definition and is actually defined as any direct investment into the domestic marketplace by a domestic company. Nearshoring Nearshoring and onshoring are very similar. The difference is that the investment does not necessarily go back into the domestic market but rather to a neighboring country (e. g. , Mexico or Canada for US-based companies). With European countries this could mean that the invest  ment takes place in the E. U. marketplace but not in the same country. Offshoring Offshoring describes the relocation of a business process from one country to another that is not necessarily a directly neighboring 4 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  country (see  Nearshoring ). Offshoring has made up a large portion of today s outsourcing business models, achieving significant cost sav  ings due to cheap labor in those outsourcing destinations.",

Outsourcing Types The outsourcing industry has been reinvented for decades. The lat  est invention is cloud services that have relabeled traditional services (e. g. , Software as a Service being a prime example now a cloud ser  vice model) to attract clients. Today there are two major outsourcing types: technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing. To reflect the variety in today s outsourcing offerings, some of the other out  sourcing types are mentioned below. Technology Outsourcing Technology outsourcing (TO) is the older of the two main outsourc  ing types. It allows a client to use the technical capabilities of an outsourcing company for its purposes. Clients do not require the com  puting power in-house anymore; instead, the outsourcing company provides its IT systems and shares them across many clients so that a required dedicated solution can be provided to a client. Business Process Outsourcing Business process outsourcing (BPO) allows an organization to out  source complete business functions instead of just technology. An outsourcing company offering BPO can provide services like human resources to a client so that the client does not need to invest in skilled personnel and office space. BPO usually involves business processes that are outside the core competency of a company. However, there has been a trend to also outsource more and more core business pro  cesses. Models like Software as a Service (SaaS) provide the foun  dation for companies like Salesforce. com to offer fully automated solutions in the BPO space, making them great examples for business process outsourcing.",

Large organizations such as AT T bought into these  co-sourcing  approaches. While not an actual joint venture, the nor  mal structure for BTO deals aims to reward outsourcing companies for delivering ongoing innovation and cost savings. The new organization is usually a mix of both the client and outsourcing companies  personnel, having its own pro forma profit and loss and profit-sharing provisions. Knowledge Process Outsourcing Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) is the fourth type of outsourc  ing that is becoming more common. It usually involves advanced research, analytical, and technical skills on the outsourcing company s side. The pharmaceutical research and development companies are great examples of an industry that makes use of this type of outsourc  ing. An example outside the pharmaceutical space is Motorola, which had the operating system for their famous Razr phone developed by a Brazilian company. This type of outsourcing usually involves shortterm and peripheral projects. The Internals of Outsourcing Obviously there is not one operating model that maps to all outsourc  ing companies. However, there are similarities between the various outsourcing companies that are a result of their history and the drive to deliver cost-efficient services to their clientele. The Phases Outsourcing deals usually follow a six-phase life cycle: 1. Strategy A company makes the strategic decision to out  source some or all of its IT or business operation. 2.",

Typical Financial Outsourcing Model Outsourcing IT or business processes creates an interesting symbi  otic relationship between the outsourcing company and the client organization. Most of the times those symbiotic relationships are not completely understood by the client or the outsourcing company. Is it crucial for both sides to understand the financial model of the out  sourcing deal, how it presents itself from the outsourcing company perspective or client side. So what are some of the typical financial characteristics of an outsourcing deal? Most of the IT outsourcing engagements are initially capital expenditures (CapEx) heavy for the outsourcing companies, with a return that increases over time as pro  cesses are optimized and further cost savings have been implemented. This maturity process is critical to the success of an outsourcing deal 7 Outsourcing since the margins in today s outsourcing world are usually paper-thin and the profit is made by volume more outsourcing engagements, more profit. BPO outsourcing deals are usually not as heavy on the CapEx but also follow a comparable life cycle when it comes to matu  rity and increased profit.

In such cost-sensitive environments compli  ance is achieved mainly through service-level agreements (SLAs) and not risk management. The picture that the outsourcing industry likes to paint, claiming to be the experts for certain technologies or pro  cesses, is in most cases not what it really is. This is mainly due to the missing synergy between engagements. Most outsourcing companies create, for the purpose of mitigating business risks, stand-alone finan  cial entities for their larger outsourcing engagements. These entities ( mini corporations ) are expected to become cash-flow positive over time. Resources are hired into these mini corporations. Sharing resources across mini corporations is usually not done or in some cases not even an option. Geographical Regions Cost plays a significant role when it comes to personnel. As a result, large outsourcing companies have operations strategically located in key high-tech locations in many low-cost countries. This trend has gone so far that even traditional US outsourcing companies have, for example, more personnel in India than in the United States. When outsourcing to such offshore locations, it is important to understand the risks that the operation in that country has to manage, ensuring that the right decision is being made, allowing for a secure operation. Even with the best business continuity measures in place, it would be wrong to assume that an outsourcing company can operate in a  bubble  at an offshore location.

IT and BP outsourcing first started in India in the mid-1980s due to its large English-speaking, low-cost workforce. India s outsourcing grew rapidly through the  90s, aided by the dot-com boom and the Y2K hype. Up to 2008 the growth was unprecedented; however, the growth rates have signifi  cantly dropped due to the global economic crisis and a disappointed Western-world customer base that is watching the record-setting cor  ruption in India. Magazines like The Economist published many arti  cles about this situation in India and how it impacts the growth in the country. One particular article, In Search of a Dream, talks about the history and why the Indian government has to step up efforts to curb the corruption in the country, which has resulted in major deficiencies in the health and educational sectors. On the other hand, the fast growth of the outsourcing industry in India has resulted in an increase in certain forms of crime, ranging from falsifying educa  tional records and resumes up to visa fraud. According to experts, the general population of 1. 2 billion (July 2013 est. ) Indians are less than acceptable to opening up to Western culture, which would help to reform the country. Examples of this denial are strikes of various groups, such as local storeowners that have opposed Western chains opening stores in India. In July 2012 India was hit with one of the largest power outages in history. Over 620 million people in 20 states were without power due to a series of outages from the aging govern  ment-owned power grid. The overdrawing by states has been deter  mined as the result of this massive outage.",

Crime has been a problem in a majority of the metropolitan areas in Indonesia. Crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and theft occur throughout the country. Indonesian police have noted an upward trend in burglaries and armed robberies in Jakarta resulting in an increase of 25 percent in 2010. Claiming to act in the name of religious or moral standards, certain extremist groups have, on occa  sion, attacked nightspots and places of entertainment. Most of these attacks have sought to destroy property rather than to injure individu  als. International news events can sometimes trigger anti-American or anti-Western demonstrations. Credit card fraud and theft are serious and growing problems in Indonesia, particularly for Westerners. Travelers who decide to use credit cards should monitor their credit card activity carefully and immediately report any unauthorized use to their financial institu  tion. ATM cards have been skimmed and cloned, resulting in bank accounts being drained. Indonesia s healthcare system generally can be rated far below US standards.

However, China s large population does not necessarily provide a competitive advantage against the established outsourcing industry. China and India are key countries used by the global sourcing industry. China s growth has resulted in some tension between these two countries, usurping a significant segment of India s outsourcing revenue year after year. China s five major cities that provide the majority of its sourcing ser  vices are Beijing; Chengdu; Shanghai, known for providing product development, research and testing, and business analytics; Shenzhen, specializing in software, application maintenance, and development; and Guangzhou, known for its engineering services. The recession in the 2010s has boosted China s service industry, including its sourcing market. The Chinese government has recog  nized an opportunity and has made significant policy changes to pro  vide better financial support, subsidies, tax breaks, and intellectual property protection to companies located in 20 pilot cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, Xian, Shanghai, and Beijing, among others. China s economy was revived during Deng Xiaoping s reign in China, after it had been demolished for decades due to foreign inva  sions.

However, the country still belongs to the low- to mid  dle-income per capita group of sourcing countries when measured on purchasing power parity. In 2009, when the global crisis resulted in less demand for Chinese exports, making the country s economy vul  nerable for the first time in many years, the government started to reform its economic policies and increase its domestic consumption to lessen the country s dependence on foreign exports. Due to its rapid economic success, China is facing major challenges including environmental damage.

As of 2012 China s total workforce is an estimated 780 million, the largest in the world. China has also an edge in language skills, especially in cities like Shanghai, where most of the engineers can speak Japanese and Chinese. Since the fall of the Cultural Revolution, China s education system has been focused on modernization. China has the highest number of university graduates in the world every year. The main language of the people is Standard Chinese or Mandarin. However, it is estimated that only 5 percent of China s population speaks English.",

It adopted its current constitution following an August 19, 2007, referendum. Approximately 95 percent of the population is of Thai descent. Its main religion is Buddhism, followed by Islam and then Christianity. Thailand is one of the countries that poses a continued risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia. The political environment in Thailand shows deep political divi  sions. Protesters holding political rallies frequently voice their opinions. Between March and May 2010 several political protests throughout Thailand took place, resulting in at least 91 deaths and injuries to more than 260 people. Political demonstrations are fre  quent events in Thailand, with many being scheduled on the anni  versary of political events and others happening with little warning.",

Westerners have been no exception and have also been victimized by drugged food and drink, usually offered by a friendly stranger who is sometimes posing as a fellow traveler on an overnight bus or train. Some foreigners have been victimized by criminals presenting themselves as police, sometimes even wearing police uniforms. In Thailand the king and the royal family are held in the highest regard, and tarnishing the image of the royal family is a serious crimi  nal offense that is punishable by a prison sentence of 3 to 15 years. Thai authorities actively search for and investigate Internet postings, including blog entries and links to other sites. Westerners have been arrested for offensive actions that occurred outside of Thailand. The Thai government has repeatedly stated that it will not toler  ate any group trying to overthrow or destabilize the governments of nearby countries. This has resulted in many US citizens who were suspected of advocating the armed overthrow of governments being  blacklisted  from entering the country.

The importation of medicine for personal use is allowed as long as the amount is less than a 30-day supply. Traveling by ferry, air, bus, or rail during periods of heavy rain usu  ally requires a check with the transportation company ahead of time to ensure that its service is still operating. If you are driving, roads might not be passable during heavy rain. In Thailand ferries and speedboats are used for transportation to and from the many islands off the Thai mainland and along rivers. Those ferries and speedboats are often overcrowded and do not carry sufficient safety equipment onboard. Many car and motorbike rental companies require the passport of the driver as a deposit. In case of damage to the rental vehicle, the passport is held until the damage has been paid for. When purchas  ing insurance from the rental company, a receipt showing you paid for insurance is advisable. Traffic accidents, minor property damage, and petty crimes are often settled through informal arbitration at a police station, with the police as arbiters or sometimes as participants. It is a traditional way of settling a dispute that Thais prefer, to avoid legal formalities and a lengthy court process. If parties cannot come to a compromise or one of the parties declines to participate, the police then will write a report and the formal judicial process begins.",

Basic medical care is available in rural areas, but English-speaking providers are rare in those areas. There is increasing concern about counterfeit medica  tions in Southeast Asia, and it is recommended to purchase medica  tion only from international chain pharmacies. Dengue and chikungunya are viral infections transmitted via mos  quitoes. These infections are endemic in Thailand and can make a person very ill and even result in death.

The accident rate is particularly high during long holidays, when alco  hol use and traffic are both heavier than normal. During Songkran (the Thai New Year) holiday celebrated in April, the traffic problems worsen due to people throwing water at passing vehicles as part of their traditional celebration. Thailand s major cities are connected through paved roads, many of which have four lanes. Speeding, reck  less driving, passing, and failing to obey traffic laws are common in most regions of Thailand. Commercial drivers commonly consume alcohol, amphetamines, and other stimulants on the job. The scarcity of ambulances and the congested roads make it nearly impossible for accident victims to receive timely medical attention. Thailand requires that all vehicles have third-party liability insurance for death or injury. However, there is no requirement for property damage insurance coverage. Bangkok has an extensive bus system; however, buses are usually overcrowded and are often driven with little or no regard for passenger safety. In conjunction, privately oper  ated vans, which are not regulated, carry 8 15 passengers within Bangkok and to and from other cities. Other cities typically have only limited public transportation and usually do not have metered taxis. In many cases, motorcycle taxis, tuk-tuks, bicycle-powered rickshaws, and pickup trucks will be the only options available for travelers with  out their own transport.

Since then the country has transformed itself into one of the top 10 outsourcing locations. In 2003 the Malaysian government started investing in pharmaceuticals, medical technology, and high-technol  ogy industries, adding to its existing value-added production chain. In June 2010, the government introduced the Tenth Malaysia Plan, which aims to attract more direct foreign investment. Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy that has an elected federal parliamentary government. Malaysia is considered a multiethnic country of 29. 6 million people (July 2013 est. ), with Malays forming the predomi  nant ethnic group. The two other large ethnic groups are Chinese and Indians. Islam is the official religion and is practiced by approximately two-thirds of the population. The official language in Malaysia is Bahasa. However, English is widely spoken. During the late-eigh  teenth and nineteenth centuries, Malaysia was occupied by Britain, and later during World War II it was occupied by Japan. The cost of living as a percentage to total net income for a per  son is approximately 27 percent lower than the cost of living in the Philippines or India. Malaysia has its own Silicon Valley known as the Multimedia Super Corridor, which in 2011 had a workforce of around 40, 000 outsourcing personnel. Even though the Malaysian government has put various initiatives in the education space into action, the literacy rate of 91 percent is still trailing behind the 93 percent of China and the Philippines. 4 4 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  Malaysia s infrastructure quality is among the highest in the world, with both road quality and electric supply being very comparable to the United States for roads and to Thailand for electric supply.",

Society Political Economy Crime Environment Infrastructure Risk Factors 46 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  Outsourcing Personnel The cost for personnel has driven most outsourcing companies to recruit more and more in low-cost countries. Some outsourcing com  panies have gone to such an extreme extent that even personnel from traditional low-cost countries such as India and the Philippines are augmented with personnel from even lower cost countries such as Egypt. The resources in those countries, which are even cheaper, usu  ally provide internal services to personnel in the outsourcing com  pany, like an internal help desk. Some groups of personnel are typical of outsourcing companies. In this section we are going to take a look at these various groups.

It is from Sun Tzu s famous book The Art of War: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

Consulting Personnel A number of outsourcing organizations are consulting companies. Some of them were always organizations with mixed businesses. Others were just consulting organizations that at some point decided to go the direction of outsourcing. The reason for many of those com  panies is the traditionally  very spiky  consulting business and the stable revenue stream from multiyear outsourcing deals allow for a more steady revenue stream and better personnel planning. One of the main advantages those former consulting companies bring to the table is experienced consultants.

With large global outsourcing engagements, one aspect becomes even more important the dif  ferent cultures of the individuals who make up the team. Issues can arise just from simple miscommunication. The cultural differences are usually an underestimated aspect in a global delivery model. Dutch researcher Geert Hofstede  has developed a well-known cultural per  sonality scheme that focuses on the ways in which culture impacts an organization. In his research he defines five dimensions: 1. Power distance The dimension that describes how different parts of a society perceive the differences and inequalities in the society. Some cultures can see everyone as equal in value, even when there are clear differences in wealth, power, edu  cation, etc. And in other cultures everyone is very aware of the differences in society, resulting in dissatisfaction or class warfare. High power distance can also be rooted in violent politics and large income inequality. The United States is an example of a culture with a large power distance.

Individualism vs. collectivism Hofstede determined that there are societies that have a strong feeling for individualism, loosely coupling those individuals and requiring each of them to look after themselves. On the other hand there are the col  lectivist societies that from birth integrate individuals into a group or family, which protects the individual in exchange for unquestioning loyalty. The United States is considered a highly individualistic society, as are most of the Western countries. On the other hand, less-developed countries and most Asian countries are considered collectivistic. A special case is Japan, which is con  sidered to fall somewhere in the middle. India with its caste system is an example of a society that integrates an individual from birth into a certain group in the society. 3. Masculinity vs. femininity The naming of this dimension might be misleading. This dimension describes which attri  butes of each gender are predominant. Male attributes like assertiveness and competitiveness or even aggressiveness are valued higher in some societies than modesty, peacefulness, nurturance, or caring for each other, which are typical female attributes. So this dimension is more about, for example, assertiveness vs. nurturing. The United States, Japan, and German-speaking countries are considered masculine societies. On the other side there are the Scandinavian countries and Holland, which are consid  ered more feminine societies. Most Asian (with the exception of Japan) countries and those in Latin America are considered moderately feminine. 4.",

Uncertainty avoidance vs. tolerance for uncertainty Uncertainty and ambiguity are perceived either as painful and to be avoided or as tolerable and sometimes even pleasurable. These differences go along with strict laws and rules in societies that try to avoid uncertainty. Another attribute of such cultures is that individuals tend to be more emotional and nervous about the future. On the other hand, in some societies individuals are more tolerant of different opinions and have fewer rules, enjoying the differences of opinions. In these societies indi  viduals tend to not express their emotions openly. 52 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  The United States is to a large part moderately tolerant of uncertainty; however, many groups within the United States clearly are not. German-speaking countries, Japan, and countries in Latin America are usually higher in uncertainty avoidance than English-speaking countries, Scandinavian countries, and Chinese-speaking countries, which are lower in uncertainty avoidance. This dimension has a direct influ  ence on the business cultures in those countries. 5. Long-term vs. short-term orientation This dimension reflects on gratification and how a culture approaches it. In societ  ies with long-term orientation, values like perseverance and thrift are important. In societies that are short-term oriented, the value of tradition, social obligations, and protecting  face  are much more important.",

In a global delivery model the five personality dimensions add to  magnify the normal friction that stems from having personnel with different personality traits on the team. Based on how individuals perceive their co-workers, their work, their relationship to the out  sourcing company and the world in general, conflict is just a ques  tion of time. Salaries Outsourcing companies are not known for high salaries. Personnel working for an outsourcing company are usually paid at the lower end of the salary range where an individual with a particular skill set would be found. This is not necessarily true for hot markets like India, where outsourcing companies are still experiencing a short  age of talent with specific skills. In recent years the competition has cooled down a little due to the overwhelming number of graduates that Indian universities have produced; however, some skills are still in high demand. 53 Outsourcing Growth Strategies When dealing with an outsourcing company, you will find two types: ones that grew organically (i. e. , success allowed the business to grow) and others that grew by acquisitions. There is probably not one out  sourcing organization that has done only one or the other. However, some organizations are on one side or the other side of the spectrum.",

The organizations that grew mainly organically usually show a strong culture, and the overall governance seems to be more mature, result  ing in functioning security processes and frameworks that allow for the replication of solutions. On the other side, there are the organiza  tions that mainly grew by acquisitions and or mergers. The merger and acquisition growth strategy in theory allows for faster growth of delivery capabilities. In reality, mergers and acquisitions are one of the leading reasons why organizations fail and eventually fold, according to an article  published by Harvard Business Review in 2008. The gen  eral misperception that drives growth by acquisition is, The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts. Cultural differences, and particularly the forming of tribes, where tribe members would rather deal with another tribe member than the best  wo-man for the job, results most of the time in less than what the two parts made up individually. The urge to form tribes usually is found in middle management, particularly with organizations that are small to mid  size and have not reached a maturity level that requires the establish  ment of solid governance, which would not allow for tribal thinking. It is advisable to research the history of an outsourcing company to avoid any surprises later on. Subpar performance on the outsourcing company side can have serious negative impact on your compliance and security. Usually activities related to security and compliance are perceived as overhead and prime candidates to be cut, that is, not executed, just to save time and money. http: hbr. org 2008 09 seven-ways-to-fail-big ar pr   http: www.",

For the purpose of this book the definition given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as published in March 2011 is used. Figure 2. 1 shows on a high level how NIST sees the current cloud offerings in the market. However, there already are  flavors  of cloud services that NIST does not really address. We will take a closer look at some of them later in this chap  ter in  Beyond the Cloud. Some people have problems in understanding what exactly the var  ious cloud definitions mean. The following sections will provide you with a definition for the three service models and the three deploy  ment models. Any combination of service model and deployment model is theoretically possible. Some might not make much sense for most organizations; however, they might be a fit for others.

Private Cloud In general private clouds are operated solely for a single organization (Figure 2. 2). They can be hosted and managed internally or by a third party. Going with a private cloud in-house is for some companies more of a technology decision and for others a business decision. There is no general rule why organizations go the route of a private cloud. If a private cloud is deployed in-house there are some factors to consider: Up-front investment To build your own private cloud, you will have to invest in hardware and, depending on what cloud framework you want to use, also in software and training for the IT personnel to build and maintain the private cloud. Scalability limits (in-house) To achieve cost savings, your organization is very likely to limit the physical cloud serv  ers to a number that your organization deems necessary to provide service during the maximum demand expected.

On the other hand a private cloud maintained or hosted by a third party offers better security than a community or public cloud hosted by a third party. Community Cloud A community cloud is operated for a group of organizations shar  ing an  interest, such as compliance security with a specific standard (Figure 2. 3). Community clouds can be seen as public clouds that are limited to a group of tenants. However, many of the security concerns that are applicable to the public cloud are also applicable to a com  munity cloud, due to the shared usage model.

Hybrid clouds offer the benefits (and some of the disadvantages) of each of the deployment models.

What the Cloud Is and Is Not Listening to some cloud enthusiasts, you could think that the cloud is the silver bullet that addresses all of our IT problems. Cloud com  puting is here to stay. Some organizations will find that moving to the cloud does not result in the expected cost savings simply because of the additional security required or the modifications that applica  tions require to take advantage of a cloud environment. All these additional expenses can easily negate any cost savings that a cloud environment would offer. In other cases the level of security might not be appropriate for the data that the application handles, even though more and more organizations lower their risk acceptance level.

The verbiage that one major cloud pro  vider added to his Service Level Agreement (SLA), clearly stating that outages of the cloud services of less than a certain number of minutes do not count against the promised SLA, might not encour  age organizations with uptime-sensitive applications to move them to that particular cloud service provider (CSP). So what exactly is the problem with the above SLA statement? It basically means that a CSP could experience an outage of two minutes, have service come back for one minute and then become unavailable for another two minutes, and still consider this as 100 percent availability uptime (assuming the SLA states three minutes as the limit for an outage). The SLAs of many larger CSPs have become the size of a telephone book, allowing the CSP to get away with situations that would be unheard of in a traditional hosting contract. Beyond the Cloud Cloud computing has become a part of the modern IT landscape. Organizations are implementing cloud solutions mainly for cost savings; however, cloud computing is beyond cost savings, allow  ing organizations to address resource issues that were impossible to solve in the past.

Right now the cloud security model is heavily relying on the hypervisor (the software that brokers between the hardware and the various operating systems) forming a barrier that separates the various virtual machines from each other.

There are some other factors that make security experts nervous, particularly with the public cloud model: According to NIST, There is a sense of location indepen  dence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowl  edge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e. g. , country, state, or datacenter)  (SP 800-145). The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general pub  lic or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services. The second bullet point by itself might not be a problem; however, when someone sells something, a service or product, economic prin  ciples apply: they need to make a profit or at least a living. Having said that, you can imagine that cloud providers are trying to shave off any expense they can, just to stay competitive. The number of public cloud providers seems to already have climbed into the hundreds, with no end to the growth anytime soon. 64 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  Virtual Private Cloud The cloud industry probably has not slept one night since the first marketing person coined the name cloud.

Virtual private cloud (VPC) is just one of these flavors, allowing the customers to use their internal resources (e. g. , data  base) instead of the cloud provider services. In most cases the cloud provider is not going to virtualize your heavyweight IT systems (e. g. , large database servers). What that means is that any applica  tion that you put in the public cloud will be required to use the cloud provider s shared database server (that this is a shared database by itself can already make some security professionals shiver). If this is not the same brand that you had before, you will need to adapt your application to it, so it can use the CSP s database server. In a VPC you have virtual private networks that are established between the cloud and your IT environment, allowing you to keep the database server in-house and still put the application into the cloud. There are other flavors that cloud providers have come up with, to distinguish themselves from the crowd of CSPs, with hundreds of companies playing in the cloud service space. Standardization between CSPs It seems that each cloud provider uses its own proprietary approach to  glue  the cloud components together. This requires cloud consum  ers to buy into this glue, customizing their solution to the proprietary layer that the cloud provider keeps to himself. The lack of standardiza  tion continues with the number of solutions that have been developed to ensure that customer data stays confidential.

If a buggy update is deployed, it can cause major outages of the cloud environment. Compliance in the Cloud Another aspect is the compliance requirements in the cloud. Many outsourcing companies offering cloud services advertise their cloud services as being, for example, compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This might sound tempting to some companies that have struggled with a cost-efficient way to achieve PCI DSS compliance; however, what the cloud offers is an infrastructure that has been certified to a certain standard with no customer applications included (i. e. , no applications run in the cloud).

Security and Privacy Issues with Cloud Computing Everyone is talking about cloud computing being insecure and that it puts at risk information and applications that are running in a cloud environment. Let s take a closer look at what the cloud offers in regard to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Scalability versus Elasticity For many organizations the availability of their services is important. In traditional IT environments, that meant that you had to invest in the hardware and software that could handle peak demand of a service or application that you offered to your customers. In cloud environ  ments this is no longer valid. A peak in demand for your service that is maybe a once in a year situation no longer requires the infrastructure 66 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  be scaled to that one time event. You can take advantage of the elas  ticity of the cloud, which provisions new servers and applications as the demand for your service increases. Once the demand goes down, the additional servers and applications are removed, and you no lon  ger pay for them. On the other hand, your business (hopefully) grows or shrinks, and you will require more or fewer cloud resources to address the basic demand that you see over the majority of the year. This is where scalability comes into the picture.",

On-Demand Self-Service With on-demand self-service, cloud environments differentiate them  selves from traditional IT environments. The CSP has virtual images of hosts that make up your cloud environment. Those images are stored either centralized or separated by cloud tenants. A centralized storage results in a shared environment that all cloud tenants use to store their images. As always, when sharing resources, the opportunity for the bad guys to break into another account is there. CSPs advertise with ver  biage like, XYZ provides a simple web-based portal that allows full control over your virtual machines. Upload virtual appliances or virtual machines directly, and then configure IP and network settings with ease. Even with an actual separation of the storage by tenant, the web front-end offered by the cloud provider is very likely the same for all cloud tenants, introducing the same risks as any other web application that is accessible over the Internet.

Rapid Elasticity This attribute allows for (theoretically) unlimited resources to address any demand for resources. As always in life, this advantage comes 67 The Cloud with a price tag not only in the form of money that goes to the CSP, but also in the form of increased risk. Elasticity is achieved by cloning resources and load balancing between all resources of the same type in the cloud. This cloning unfortunately results in a loss of integrity with your logs. At a cloud resource level, the cloning is visible, but at an application level, the cloning might not be vis  ible. For example, instead of one web server, suddenly two web serv  ers are logging into a central log server. (Note: Local logging in a cloud environment does not make much sense due to the fact that an instance of a server can be decommissioned at any given time, result  ing in the loss of all local data. ) At any given time the second web server can be decommissioned, stopping the logging to the central  ized log server. Looking at the log file might show a problem with one of the web servers; however, in the worst case scenario, one could not distinguish between the two servers, or the server that logged the problem may no longer be available. Here is another example that should further clarify the problem of cloud elasticity: imagine a group of users that shares the same login credentials. In most cloud setups, clones of the same system use the same login credentials to log into a database for example. This could result in quite some confusion when a forensic analysis is required on the logins.",

Metering The metering of resources itself is not the problem, but it is another factor in an equation that got more complex when cloud services were introduced to the IT world. These metering mechanisms that deter  mine what you need to pay can be the target of an attack, trying to manipulate the mechanism to believe that you have used extensive cloud resources, which you need to pay for. In a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, the resources being used result in an extensive bill since you pay for use of resources in the cloud. In a traditional IT infra  structure you pay for power, support, rack space, and cooling, where a DoS attack will also result in higher costs but not significantly higher costs.

Virtual Networks With the introduction of virtual networks and virtual switches, new problems for network security have arisen. The traditional NIDS and Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) cannot see the traffic that flows across the virtual network between the virtual machines. A potential infection due to a worm that replicates across the network is invisible to the NIDS NIPS that only sees traffic going and coming from the hardware host, not the network traffic that flows between all the virtual machines on that particular hardware host. Some compa  nies have come up with solutions that potentially can help with this situation, providing virtual NIDS NIPS solutions. Unfortunately, those solutions usually require a virtual instance dedicated to NIDS  NIPS, taking away capacity from the hardware host. This might be one reason why this technology has not gotten the traction that you would expect. A workaround to this is that some CSPs turn off the internal virtual switch, forcing traffic to always go the way of the physical network interface. Memory Allocation Wiping One area of concern for some security experts is the allocation and wiping of memory that virtual machines use. It is a result of the elas  ticity of the cloud, which happens not only vertically (more machines) but also horizontally (more memory, additional CPU cores). The OS that runs on a virtual machine is responsible for the memory manage  ment. If the OS does not properly wipe the memory before it frees it up, then there is the chance that data is left behind in those memory blocks, which another virtual machine then allocates. This is true for disc storage as well as actual RAM.",

This is true for disc storage as well as actual RAM. An attacker could in theory just allocate memory and read it before initializing it, to potentially gain access to passwords or other sensitive data that another virtual machine had left behind. To execute this type of attack, an attacker only needs to request new virtual instances or more memory and release it after reading the new memory that had been allocated to 71 The Cloud the virtual machine. In a very busy public cloud environment, there is a chance that the attacker gains access to some confidential data eventually, even though modern operating systems have gotten much better in addressing such issues, still they are not perfect. If you have an application that uses confidential data, it is probably a good idea to have the application overwrite the content of a memory block (vari  able, field, etc. ) with a special routine. Solutions like VMware DRS and PRO can help in load balancing across multiple hosts and also in scrubbing any resources, especially storage and RAM, before they are reassigned. When a CSP uses such a solution, this can add an addi  tional layer of security. Just make sure that the CSP uses the memory scrubbing setting and that memory and storage are scrubbed before being reused. Cloud Network Configuration One of the key network elements of cloud is Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN). So what are VLANs, and why are they so impor  tant for the cloud?",

VLANs are configured at a switch level, distinguishing network traf  fic based on one out of the five criteria: VLAN membership by port The ports on a switch are assigned a particular VLAN. For example, if a switch has 8 ports, ports 1 to 4 may be configured to belong to VLAN 1, and ports 5 to 8 may be configured with VLAN 2. VLAN membership by MAC address The MAC address of the network interface card (NIC) determines what VLAN a switch assigns to the port that the NIC is connected to. Membership by protocol type The layer 2 header contain  ing the protocol type field is used by the switch to decide to which VLAN to associate a network packet. Membership by IP subnet address The VLAN association is based on the layer 3 header. The switch determines, based on the layer 3 IP address, the association to a VLAN. http: www. cs. purdue. edu homes bb cs590 papers secure_vm. pdf 72 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  In many modern cloud configurations, switches are able to assign Private VLAN (PVLAN) IDs based on the IP subnet address. Private VLANs are divided into two groups: Primary PVLAN Primary PVLANs are divided into smaller groups called secondary PVLANs. Secondary PVLANs Secondary PVLANs exist only inside the primary PVLAN they are assigned to. Each sec  ondary PVLAN has a unique VLAN ID associated to it. Each packet traveling through a PVLAN is tagged with the associated ID of the PVLAN, just as a normal VLAN.",

Typically routers are attached to promiscuous ports. Isolated A node attached to a port in an isolated secondary PVLAN may only send to and receive packets from the pro  miscuous PVLAN. Typically physical hosts carrying virtual machines (VMs) are connected to isolated ports. Community A node attached to a port in a community sec  ondary PVLAN may send to and receive packets from other ports in the same secondary PVLAN, as well as send to and receive packets from the promiscuous PVLAN.

This small introduction to VLANs and PVLANs might already give you an idea of how complex cloud network configurations can become (Figure 2. 7). Most of this is automated. However the com  plexity is traditionally the enemy of security. A misconfiguration of the switch fabric could have a disastrous impact on the security in the cloud. Sources for that could be a buggy firmware update for switches or routers with incorrect routing or simply human error (e. g. , connect  ing the wrong devices).

The problem with this approach is that the configuration of the virtual firewalls can be quite tricky, particularly if a solution scheduled to be deployed was not writ  ten for a cloud environment. The elasticity of the cloud environment can further add to this complexity. Looking at the virtual firewall approach, with the firewall being implemented at the virtualization layer, you will notice that there is a  software connection  between the virtual machines via the hypervisor that a malicious user could use to connect two virtual machines directly. This is a risk that most cloud users accept. The hypervisor, however, is not the only connec  tion. The virtual switch creates not only a network connection but also a software connection. While drawings show a virtual switch for each virtual machine, in reality most virtualization solutions deploy a single software switch, which is then broken up into multiple logical partitions. This type of configuration is done to minimize the foot  print of the switch on the host server. Those are two shortcomings of the virtualization layer that might require a change in the design of the current virtual firewall implementations. Currently there are three types of virtual firewall deployment methods: VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM VM Physical Host A. 1 Host A. 1 VMs IP: 10. 1. 1. 3   VM A. 1. 1 IP: 10. 1. 1. 5   VM A. 1. 2 IP: 10. 1. 4. 3   VM A. 3. 1 IP: 10. 1. 5. 5   VM A. 3. 2 IP: 10. 1. 1. 3   VM A. 1. 1 IP: 10. 1. 1. 5   VM A. 1. 2 IP: 10. 1. 2. 3   VM A. 2. 1 IP: 10. 1. 3. 3   VM A. 2. 2 IP: 10. 1. 6. 5   VM A. 2. 3 Host A. 2 VMs Host A. 3 VMs Host B. 1 VMs 10. 1. 1. 0 24 10. 1. 2. 0 24 10. 1. 3. 0 24 10. 1. 6.",

Bridge-mode virtual firewalls A firewall appliance is installed and interacts with the virtual switch, routing all traffic that flows through the virtual switch also through the virtual firewall appliance (Figure 2. 9).

Edward Snowden  is probably a famous example of a system administrator who used his access to steal information. Depending on the geographic region where the cloud provider hosts its service, the requirements for back  ground investigations will vary quite a bit. The laws that govern your right to data in the cloud or the protection of that data against thirdparty access can also vary quite a bit across the major outsourcing countries. The initially cheap CSP might become an expensive expe  rience after the data has been stolen, corrupted, or is no longer avail  able. The problem with some of the public cloud offerings is that most CSPs try to avoid providing any geographic boundaries where your data is stored. This can also create serious issues if you have compli  ance requirements that require you to host the data within a certain geographic region (e. g. , European countries). Availability and Service Level Agreements Looking at some of the SLAs that CSPs have posted you might start thinking that those provide you with everything you need to ensure availability of your services and data. Let s take a closer look at these SLAs, what to look for, and how to recognize terminology or potential claims that are simply unrealistic and should alert you to the credibility of the CSP.

It is obvious that we all want to have a 100 percent uptime guarantee. However, someone offering this might not be as straightforward to you as you might want him or her to be. CSPs vary in how they express their uptime guarantee. Some use monthly guarantees; others use annual uptime guaran  tees. So which one is better? A monthly uptime guarantee seems to be the better deal. Why is that? Monthly uptime guarantees are prefer  able because the window is smaller, allowing for less time to iron out a potential outage. To better understand this, let s take a look at a sce  nario: A CSP experiences an outage of 4 h in a particular month and has no further outages for the next 11 months. This would result in an annual uptime of 99. 95 percent. However the 4 h outage can have a significant impact on your operations. On the other hand, a monthly uptime guarantee of 99. 95 percent would result in a maximum allow  able monthly outage time of 21 min and 36 sec. A 4 h outage would in this case entitle you to at least a service credit with a CSP that has a 79 The Cloud monthly uptime guarantee of 99. 95 percent, but not with the CSP that uses an annual uptime guarantee of 99. 95 percent.

In this case it is the difference between monthly and annual uptime guarantee. It is important that these uptime promises are made for the cloud as a whole, which brings up another interesting part of the SLA to understand: hardware failures. Hardware failed in traditional data centers, and it is going to fail in cloud environments. It is important to understand that if a server that had your virtual image on it fails, the uptime SLA of the cloud is usually not applied. Hardware failures are traditionally excluded and can be found in the exclusion section of the SLA, since the cloud tenant is responsible to make a service redundant, avoiding downtime due to an individual hardware failure. Such outages are normally covered by the exclusion clause of the SLA and are the responsibility of the customer. When deploying an application in the cloud, it is a good idea to follow cloud best prac  tices  (not only applicable to Amazon s EC2 even though some of the practices reference EC2-only services). One of them is to always make your services redundant to avoid a hardware failure causing you downtime. These cases are covered by the acceptable downtime metric, which is calculated for outages that impact the vast majority of services or customers. Surprisingly, most CSPs seem not to define exactly what  vast majority  means, leaving them some flexibility with the require  ment to notify customers.

In most cases you are the one that has to prove that you are entitled to a credit. As a last warning, expecting that during a free trial any of the uptime guarantees are in place might prove a very wrong assumption. When using a trial or Beta of a cloud service, it is advisable to use it for what it is intended to try out the service, not to run any critical production applications in the trial or Beta cloud service.

Authentication, Authorization, Accounting Numerous articles by security professionals have pointed out that CSPs are not there yet, with their implementation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) in the cloud. These three A s stand for the trail of evidence that could be used in forensic cases, proving that a particular user or system gained access. Below are com  mon definitions for what those three principles stand for: Authentication The process where an entity s identity is verified, typically by providing evidence that it holds a spe  cific digital identity such as an identifier and the correspond  ing credential(s). Examples of credentials are passwords, one-time tokens, digital certificates, digital signatures, and phone numbers (calling called). Authorization The permissions that a particular entity has, relative to a given activity on an object. Typically authoriza  tion is tied to the initial authentication when logging on to an application or service. However, authorization may also be determined based on a range of other criteria, for example, timeof-day restrictions, physical location restrictions, or restrictions on number of instances of sessions of the same entity or user. Most basic access can be defined by read, write, change, or delete rights to a specific object (e. g. , file or data element). Accounting The tracking of network resource consump  tion by users or systems for the purpose of capacity and trend analysis, cost allocation, and billing. The tracking usu  ally includes the recording of events such as authentication 81 The Cloud and authorization failures.",

In SaaS the importance of AAA is critical to deliver a successful ser  vice to customers and also to bill for it. Even in the private cloud the AAA concept is important to achieve the maximum benefits of cloud computing, allowing for dynamic resource allocation, as they are needed. Only with AAA in place can departments be billed based on their usage of the cloud. The cloud is a self-service world that makes you as the tenant responsible for making sure the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right time. Currently resources and basic access to those resources are provided by the CSA. More and more CSPs offer provisioning workflows, enabling their customers to have the right people gain access to the necessary resources without wait  ing for manual IT intervention. To achieve this level of automation, it is critical to properly manage authentication, authorization, and accounting. The criticism that organizations like the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) have brought forward is mainly targeting the imple  mentation of insecure interfaces to software that is used to manage and interact with cloud services. These interfaces so far have not shown the level of security that a well-designed service or application would have, mainly lacking maturity with authentication, access con  trol, and encryption.

A SAS-70 audit only looked at the controls and processes that the data center operator had identified, and whether they were executed as intended. The SAS-70 audit standard did not establish a minimum bar that the data center operator had to achieve, nor did a benchmark hold data center operators accountable.

When using an encryption scheme that is fully homomorphic, the cloud applications can perform meaningful computations on the encrypted data. Unfortunately, at the current time, fully homo  morphic encryption schemes have quite a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Zvika Brakerski, Craig Gentry, and Vinod Vaikuntanathan in their white paper titled, Fully Homomorphic Encryption without Bootstrapping, presented a promising approach to homomorphic encryption. The approach presented by the three researchers is the basis for a software library implementation called HELib, which is available for free on GitHub. However, to use homomorphic encryption, an application would need to be rewritten, a potentially large and costly effort that in most cases is not feasible. Until homomorphic encryption becomes more integrated into everyday application development, the advice given by Bruce Schneier, a leading cryptography expert, still holds: have an enforce  able contract with the CSP. This advice is nothing new and is not only valid for cloud computing. What Bruce was referring to is that CSPs  terms of service include pages of fine print that ensure that the CSP is not liable. For example, public clouds can be operated in various geographic locations, and exactly where your operation is currently located will not be known to you. This is a serious problem for organizations that process or store certain data that cannot leave a geographic region or country. One public cloud provider now even offers cloud storage in return for local storage. This means that you provide local storage on your hard drive to the cloud.

This would be an extreme case of what can happen; however, it demon  strates that the model of  location independence  is not without flaws. Encrypting all your data and not storing the encryption keys in the cloud is one approach. However, this model relies on one safeguard, which is the encryption. AES-256 is, in the year 2012, considered a safe crypto algorithm when used with a  strong  key. In 10 years the use of AES-256 might be considered insecure. Technology advances, and computing power becomes cheaper and cheaper every year. At the same time mathematicians continue to research equations and prime factorization that are the foundation of modern cryptography, coming up with new approaches for how to calculate complex encryp  tion problems faster. So it is just a question of time before your only safeguard is more an annoyance than an obstacle to get to the infor  mation you are trying to protect. Encryption Keys and the Cloud Due to compliance and security reasons, most CSPs, if not all, have so far recommended not to store encryption keys in the cloud. Some new services (e. g. , Amazon s CloudHSM) provide clients who need to meet data security compliance requirements with a way to meet those requirements by using a dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) offered by the CSP. Until now CSPs (e. g. , Amazon) 85 The Cloud recommended to many clients that had sensitive data, or the encryp  tion keys to it, not to store it in the cloud but in their own on-premise data centers. This made it impossible for many companies to fully migrate their applications to a CSP-operated cloud.",

With the offering of HSM by the CSP, clients can now take advantage of encryptionenabled services (e. g. , database encryption, digital rights manage  ment, public key infrastructure, etc. ). HSMs are usually offered in conjunction with the VPC cloud model. The HSM appliances are provisioned inside the user s virtual private cloud (VPC) with an IP address the user specifies. Amazon, for example, advertises that its CloudHSM service has HSMs that are  tamper-resistant appliances that are designed to comply with international (Common Criteria EAL4 ) and US government (NIST FIPS 140-2) regulatory stan  dards for cryptographic modules.

This requires the US federal government to first evaluate a cloud-based solution before investigat  ing other solutions. This policy tries to achieve cost savings by using cloud technology, which has lower costs than the traditional IT solu  tions. As a next step in OMB s efforts to achieve cost savings, the federal government established a federal cloud certification with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP s cloud certification allows CSPs to demonstrate their compliance with the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  for a moderate rated system. At the cur  rent time, FISMA identifies three levels of system categorization: High, Medium, and Low. Those levels have been defined in the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199. The security controls that are implemented with a cloud which has been categorized as mod  erate and is certified by FedRAMP can be found in NIST SP 800-53, which is constantly revised and updated. It can be said that clouds that have been certified by FedRAMP offer better security than the plain vanilla clouds that CSPs offer to the public.",

The control can stay in place and very likely requires only some configuration changes. A traditional security control s objective maps to the same objective of a security control in the cloud. The cloud security control is different from the traditional security control. The cloud security control would replace the traditional control in the cloud. The traditional security control cannot be used in a cloud environment, and no cloud security control exists that has the same control objective. In this case an analysis needs to be performed to see which compensating controls are available in the cloud that would result in an acceptable residual risk level. Identify controls that address cloud-specific risks that are introduced by running an application or storing information in a cloud environment. The most challenging task is to understand the game changers that the cloud introduced. For example, cloud elasticity: an IP address does not mean much in the cloud. It is assigned at one point in time to a virtual instance of a host. The moment the instance is not needed anymore, the cloud decommissions the virtual host, releasing the IP, which then can be reused with another virtual instance of another host, which might belong to another tenant of the cloud. Host-level authenticity is com  plicated because the cloud clones instances, and there is little or no cus  tomization (e. g. , assign IP) that happens when a host is cloned.",

Memory routines should ensure that memory that is being used for sensitive information (e. g. , passwords) is wiped by the application, and it is not relying on the OS to wipe the memory.

The application should support the metering that the cloud offers to ensure that the CSP properly bills you for the cloud resources being used.",

Applications must be adjusted to allow for  many-to-many  communication. In most cases the cloud handles this with load balancers. However, the servers and applications sitting behind those load balancers need to be aware of these manyto-many relationships to properly function in the cloud. Applications using fancy ways to facilitate network communi  cation will be difficult to adapt to a cloud environment. When I say fancy, I am referring to some homegrown load balanc  ing or the spoofing of IPs or anything else that goes beyond normal transmission control protocol (TCP) or user datagram protocol (UDP) communication with the host IP. The CSP will not very likely allow you to use this fancy communication since part of their security controls is to tightly control the IP allocation. Otherwise, it would be impossible to shape and control the flow of network traffic in a public cloud. 89 3 Before You Decide to Outsource The question  What are the risks? is not easily answered and has more aspects to it than just from a security perspective: for example, how agile does my IT need to be to support our business?

Times have changed, but not human curiosity or the fear of missing out on a detail that could be terrorism related or in some cases be used for corporate espionage. So-called signals intelligence (SIGINT)-gathering systems are capa  ble of gathering information from satellite communication, microwave links (as used by telephone companies to bridge long distances), wire  less services (cell phone service) and cordless phones. ECHELON is one system that performs SIGINT by collecting and analyzing worldwide communication. The ECHELON network is operated on behalf of five countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) according to the UKUSA Security Agreement. ECHELON was originally created to monitor   http: www. nsa. gov public_info press_room 2010 ukusa. shtml. 92 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s. The European Parliament formed a committee during 2000 and 2001 to investigate ECHELON and issued a report in 2001. The report stated that the ECHELON is used in a number of contexts but that evidence indicates that ECHELON stands for a signals intelligence collection system. This investigation uncovers an interesting situation with the UK, which is part of the European Union (EU) and is also actively involved with ECHELON. It is suspected that the five mem  ber countries have divided up the monitoring responsibilities.",

It is suspected that the five mem  ber countries have divided up the monitoring responsibilities. Australia eavesdrops for communication that originates in Indochina, Indonesia, and southern China. Canada used to monitor the northern portions of the former Soviet Union and conducted sweeps of all forms of commu  nication that could be picked up from embassies around the world. After the Cold War era ended, the focus shifted to monitoring satellite, radio, and cell phone traffic originating from Central and South America to track drugs and non  aligned paramilitary groups in that region. New Zealand is targeting the western Pacific with listening sta  tions in the South Island at Waihopai Valley and on the North Island at Tangimoana. Locals hold regular protests against the listening posts, demanding that they be closed down. United Kingdom is responsible for monitoring communi  cation in Europe, Africa, and the European part of Russia. There have been cases in which companies located in nonECHELON participating countries suspected that the ECHELON system was used to provide UK- or US-based companies a competitive advantage by passing recorded infor  mation to companies in their countries. United States monitors most of Latin America, Asia, Asiatic Russia, and northern China. The report issued by the EU also concludes that ECHELON was capa  ble of eavesdropping on and analyzing telephone calls, faxes, e-mail, and other data traffic that traverse via satellite transmission, microwave links, and public-switched telephone networks (carrying Internet traffic during the early stages of the Internet revolution).",

It has been suspected 93 Before You Decide to Outsource for quite some time that ECHELON is used not only to protect the national security of the five member states but also for industrial espi  onage. Germany s national intelligence agency, Verfassungsschutz, has warned German businesses and the German industry commu  nity against ECHELON since June 1999, when it recommended that German companies encrypt all important information encode it to prevent ECHELON stations from picking up the communication and using it to their advantage. The Verfassungsschutz even issued in 2008 a brochure  to German companies providing guidance on how to protect sensitive information, not mentioning ECHELON but clearly stating that communication can be eavesdropped on. e-Mail In the early days of e-mail communication, the e-mail servers exchanged the content of e-mails in clear text across the Internet. Since these early days, this has changed, and many e-mail servers now offer secure transmission of e-mails via the Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This allows for secure communication between e-mail servers. To check if TLS is in place, you can inspect the full-header of an e-mail that con  tains the server handshake part. If the header contains a line like this (or similar the keyword is TLS), (version   TLSv1 cipher   RC4SHA bits   128 128), then TLS version 1 was used to secure the communication from one e-mail server to another.",

A prominent victim of the weakness of RC4 was the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol that is nowadays considered highly insecure. Too often individuals (particular auditors) seem to check only for the word TLS in the header of an e-mail and do not actually pay attention to the actual cipher that is being used. With computing power doubling every two to three years (see Moore s   http: www. verfassungsschutz. de de oeffentlichkeitsarbeit publikationen  pb-spionage-und-proliferationsabwehr broschuere-4-0806-wirtschaftsspionage (in German). http: www. schneier. com blog archives 2013 03 new_rc4_attack. html 94 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  law ), a weak crypto algorithm can easily result in no obstacle at all after just a couple of months or years. In the United States and in Europe, the governments are actively discussing the storage of information about communication that takes place using e-mail, social media, or telephone. The approaches that the EU and the United States are pursuing vary. The EU approach in general only requires the storage of envelope information of an e-mail but not the actual content of the e-mail.

Civil rights activists heavily criticize the practice of screening e-mails. Agencies such as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation conduct screening operations regularly. The American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations alleged that Verizon illegally gave the US government unrestricted access to its entire Internet traffic without a warrant and that AT T had a similar arrangement with the NSA.

The sky seems to be the limit when it comes to analysis of data gathered: a target s community of interest, a single person swapping SIM cards, or even throwing away phones no problem. Smartphones The success of smartphones around the globe is unprecedented. Particularly the younger generation has adopted this new technology, using it wherever they can: e-mail, text (SMS), one-time access code applications, and so forth. Unfortunately, smartphones have become the target not only of criminals but also governments, which want to control any information that might go against the regime in that coun  try. Western countries use  government spyware  on smartphones, too. One company that has tapped into this market is Gamma International, a UK-based company marketing a spyware called FinFisher, under the description  IT intrusion and remote monitoring solution. FinFisher is supposedly only offered to law enforcement and intelligence agencies to covertly monitor criminals. However, according to researchers, it has been used by repressive regimes, for example, by the Bahraini govern  ment to spy on dissidents. According to some analysis, a demo version of the FinFisher software was in some cases reverse-engineered to a cer  tain degree removing the demo mode limitations. FinFisher is available in versions that work on mobile phones of all major brands. FinFisher has the ability to take control of target smartphones and capture even encrypted data and communications.

Early versions of instant messaging appeared already in multiuser operating systems like Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) and Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (Multics) in the mid-1960s.

Even if your com  puter is not the direct target of an attack, the user around the globe could not run antivirus software on their computer and would get infected with malware. Compliance issues In the United States alone there are more than 10, 000 laws and regulations related to elec  tronic communication and records retention. Some of the well-known ones include the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and SEC 17a-3 requiring that certain exchange members are required to create records in a certain way. For example, in December 2007 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued to member firms in the financial services industry a clarification stating that the terms electronic communications, e-mail, and electronic corre  spondence may be used interchangeably and do include elec  tronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging. This ruling states that companies that are required to be in compliance with it record IM and text messages since many IM communications fall into the category of business com  munications, which must be archived and retrievable accord  ing to SEC 17a-3.

This sometimes involves the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network protocol. UDP is not known for its security and allows for spoofing of com  munication sources. Social engineering Just like the traditional form of social engineering, IM has been used to claim the identity of some  one to gather information. Sometimes the IM name varies by only one character, using the limitations of character sets. For example, I and 1 or O and 0 are often swapped for each other to create an IM name that on the first glance looks like the name of a trusted person. Leakage of confidential information IM applications usu  ally use communication protocols that are in plain text, mak  ing them vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. Another area of concern is that many IM protocols are not peer-to-peer protocols but traverse through servers of the company offer  ing the free IM solutions. There have been many speculations why this is being done since it creates a cost overhead for the company offering the free service to the public. IM has been widely used by outsourcing companies; however, the risks that the usage of IM introduces must meet up with your risk appetite and compliance requirements.

Yes, you know where your letter or parcel is; however, tracking does not help much when the letter or parcel has been delivered to the wrong address and the signature is completely unreadable or no signature has been recorded. In most cases interna  tional shipments require additional paperwork, such as customs forms that need to be filled out. In some countries, parcels or larger envelopes are routinely opened and inspected. Those inspections serve different purposes, depending on how stable the regime is in a certain country. 99 Before You Decide to Outsource Organizational Impacts Outsourcing companies offer solutions that would allow a chief executive officer to have a whole company operate by buying only outsourcing services. Ranging from the technical staff up to the man  agement team, everything and everyone can be outsourced nowadays. Outsourcing companies have become quite sophisticated in their offerings, building a pool of staff that can provide nearly any service your company might need. But what does that really mean? It means that your company has to put additional measures in place to address individuals employed by a third party having access to buildings, servers, files, information, and more.

However, if you are a national corporation that maybe operates in only a handful of states in the United States, you might not be familiar with how local law can vary from country to country. For example, outsourcing to India will allow the Indian government to gain access to the systems that your organization uses in India and might contain confidential informa  tion. It is critical that before any contract is put in place, a lawyer with expertise in international law and outsourcing initiatives provides you with guidance and does a final review of a complex outsourcing con  tract. The protection of intellectual property (IP) is not unified across the globe, and it would not be the first time that a local company in the country where you have your outsourced operation suddenly has inside knowledge of what your organization has kept as a wellprotected secret for years.

Technical Challenges This section is a little technology heavy, diving into some of the quickly overlooked foot traps that outsourcing can bring with it. For the pur  pose of this section, a Technology Outsourcing (TO) engagement is assumed with a client that is going to outsource its IT infrastructure. Network Address Translation (NAT) Issues In some cases you will have your existing network tied into the net  work of the outsourcing provider. This setup usually brings challenges with it since in some cases address collisions can happen. For example, if your organization uses a 192. 168. 2. 0 24 network and the outsourc  ing company uses the same address range, you will need to imple  ment NAT.

It gets even more complex when two organizations have a mixed workforce that needs to access systems in both organizations. Not only login credentials but also the access rights that each user requires need to be shared 101 Before You Decide to Outsource across organizational borders.

To solve this problem can easily fill a book by itself. Backup Technologies There have been many backup technologies and standards over the years. Organizations bought into a vendor or standard at one point in time. Now that this task gets transitioned to an outsourcing company, this could mean that the company has its own standard that it uses for all of its clients. Once it transitions and the old backup solution is decommissioned, your organization might be at risk of falling out of compliance if you are required to have a certain number of years of data available.",

Remote Desktop Support With having support teams in sometimes faraway countries, the remote desktop support solution that used to work is now not working anymore. Network latency prevents any meaningful network commu  nication between the computer of the support personnel and the user that has a problem with their computer. Trouble Ticket Systems Larger or even midsize outsourcing companies will have their own trouble ticket system (e. g. , Remedy, osTicket, to name just two), often referred to as a ticketing system. Usually those trouble ticket systems do not talk to each other. Some might offer interfaces to import or export 102 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  certain message formats, but even with that it can be tricky to have two systems talk to each other. So when keeping your own ticketing system, it might be challenging to have tickets cross over to the out  sourcing company s trouble ticketing system.

The effort to fix those issues can be so high that it takes months before it is working reliably. In the meantime the outsourcing company will have someone take tickets out of your trouble ticket system and retype them into the outsourcing company s trouble ticket system. This can easily introduce human error or mess up the SLA calculation completely. Business Continuity How does this new relationship survive a natural disaster like a hur  ricane? The overall picture of business continuity and its dependencies suddenly have become quite complex. There is probably not one com  pany that I can think of that does not have a dependency on another company so it is able to conduct its business.

Those are relatively straightforward relationships that can be addressed. With the level of outsourcing nowadays, even mission-critical pro  cesses and functions are outsourced. Sometimes the outsourcing com  pany further outsources certain elements of its operation; e. g. , many Indian outsourcing companies were using workers in Egypt for their internal support functions, as they were cheaper than the local Indian workforce. When the Arab spring started, the Egyptian govern  ment blocked all Internet access to outside of the country, impacting the operation of Indian outsourcing companies delivering service in North America. I think this example illustrates how complex these dependencies have become in a global economy. To understand this, 103 Before You Decide to Outsource someone would need to understand the whole picture. Unfortunately, this is nearly impossible with the complexity in place, and it is rather a common practice to have the outsourcing company prove that it has conducted its business continuity exercise. On the other hand, the business continuity exercises that most outsourcing companies con  duct have only limited input from the clients they serve. 105 4 Ready to Outsource Most organizations have established a well-defined appetite for risk when doing business.

To be clear, there is no perfect outsourcing company out there. There might be an outsourcing company that is a better match for your organization and others that are less of a match. For sure you will need to com  promise.

To really understand a particular outsourcing company s capabilities, organiza  tions need to do quite a lot of homework. Too many companies jumped on the bandwagon called outsourcing. And someone might be surprised in what the organization bought into once they have had their first visit to the offshore facility of the outsourcing company. There are several aspects that can be used as indicators for the security capabilities of an outsourcing company: 1. Corporate culture (not maturity level as the Capability Maturity Model Integration  CMMI  program understands it) What is the average turnover rate within the organization? With most organizations that have a high turnover rate, there is usually an underlying problem, a problem that you might inherit when hiring the company. A human resources department that is overworked with on- and off-boarding of resources, or a work  force that is inexperienced in executing mature processes and unknown to the  new guy gal  hired three weeks ago. A high turnover rate also results in people bringing their own ways and opinion of doing things. This is OK when you are looking for innovation; however, if the organization just consists of new hires with few  old-timers  around, it will have issues in func  tioning well. The same goes for companies that grew mainly by merger and acquisitions. They usually have a hard time build  ing a corporate culture. 2.

If an outsourcing company on average has a two-to-one subcontractor ratio, then the contractual over  head is a major challenge, not to mention the work culture aspect (see point above). If those subcontractors are even dif  ferent across the various outsourcing engagements, it is ques  tionable if issues can be resolved in a reasonable time and with reasonable involvement of resources (e. g. , contract personnel researching, lawyers being the next level if no resolution can be found). Each outsourcing company will have a number of subcontractors supporting the effort, particularly if there are some  hand-tailored  items that are unique to your orga  107 Ready to Outsource nization; still it creates a level of complexity that is usually underestimated. 3. Ability to implement enforce security processes and standards This has always been a challenge across organizational boundaries. With an outsourcing organization it becomes even more criti  cal. What does the outsourcing organization offer for train  ing, enforcement, documentation, and evidence collection? Is the organization well familiar with security controls, or is this done as a  must do? An outsourcing organization might need to have audits conducted to be in compliance. This does not mean that those controls are the same as those you require; sometimes those controls are at a different level than yours. So your controls would need to be added or supersede the outsourcing company s controls. In any case, controls are only as good as the people who are responsible for them. 4.

Many outsourcing organizations have the tendency to  grab  whatever deal they can get, claim  ing the ability to support any technology. Yes, you could go the route of transformation with your environment, but that could easily cost you more than running it on your own. So most of the time the outsourcing company takes your tech  nology and incorporates it into their environment. If you use technology that is not standardized, you will easily fall into the trap of losing experienced staff, and you suddenly have a quite inexperienced outsourcing staff trying to maintain this specialized piece of technology. The outsourcing companies usually have IT staff cross-trained in various technologies; still you will hardly find a Windows administrator that is also a full-fledged UNIX administrator. Another aspect is cost; UNIX administrators are usually paid higher than Windows administrators. To keep costs low, the outsourcing company is constantly trying to minimize the need for more human resources and maximize the utilization of the existing staff. There is not much room for resources with specialized skills. 5. Process maturity (e. g. , CMMI) Usually used by outsourcing organizations for advertisement. In reality those organiza  tions might have achieved a certain CMMI level within a 108 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  certain part of the organization. This does not mean that sud  denly your organization, that has struggled to even achieve CMMI level 2, will see a boost in process maturity.

Average time of background investigations This can vary quite a bit across countries. A background investigation taking three months or longer is not unusual in certain countries. Outsourcing companies are looking for cheap labor, and most of the countries that are used to find resources to staff the next engagement have problematic background inves  tigations. Another factor is the rate of background investi  gations that result in firing someone who has already been hired (i. e. , the resume was fake) or in a delay in onboarding the individuals. All those are metrics that go to the core of human resources, and most outsourcing companies will not openly share those with you. If this is the case, job boards (e. g. , Glassdoor) sometimes can paint a picture of what is going on with a particular outsourcing company. Another approach is to get some larger and smaller customers of the outsourcing organization (all with the permission of the out  sourcing organization) to talk with you. 7. Ability to map your security architecture to the new outsourced company environment Building a security architecture that works from soup to nuts can take years. To push this into a virtualized environment or even further into a cloud envi  ronment can result in a serious setback. Metrics that are not available anymore, and security controls and processes that need to be adjusted to a potential new environment resulting in gaps.

Vendor relationships Another critical aspect of how good outsourcing companies can address your needs. Most of the larger outsourcing companies have close ties to vendors that provide solutions to them (this sometimes goes hand in hand with the subcontractor situation and the level of standard  ization of IT). Outsourcing organizations have created those close ties to gain discounts with certain vendors.

Ability to understand your business This is critical for the suc  cess of outsourcing engagements that go beyond IT (i. e. , server gets moved to an outsourcing data center). It starts with the help desk, which usually is part of IT outsourcing engage  ments, and can be as simple as cultural issues. For example, Joe working in the trenches, laying pipes in the ground, and having to use a laptop to provide update reports to his boss, back in the office. This guy is very likely not pleased with hav  ing to deal with someone over the phone, who potentially has an accent and is not accustomed to American slang. Another level is business processes that might be critical to your busi  ness. If the outsourcing company has a good understanding of your business, potentially also works with one of your com  petitors, then they will ensure that those processes get the appropriate attention and urgency. Most of the time the out  sourcing company has some personnel allocated across vari  ous outsourcing engagements. Those individuals will have a 110 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  hard time adjusting to the nuances of your processes, working sometimes 2 3 different client engagements. 10.",

There have been cases where information was available to a competitor who was also using the same out  sourcing company. Whether those two companies were always aware of the situation is another question. However, it can be critical to your company to have intellectual property protected against unauthorized access. Those are just some of the more important factors that should be considered when picking an outsourcing company. In the end, your organization will need to come up with your own evaluation criteria that align with your business, your systems, process, and more impor  tantly, your risk tolerance. Understand What Is Offered It is one thing to understand what is needed; it is another thing to understand what is offered. Nowadays outsourcing companies offer a wide variety of services. Believing the marketing and sales departments of the outsourcing companies makes you think that the sky is the limit. Unfortunately this does not necessarily align with the delivery capabili  ties that those companies really have. Some of them might try to use you as the guinea pig for the latest (sometimes not even productionready) offering. Margins are small in the outsourcing industry, and a solution that might slice off another dollar or two is interesting for any  one in the outsourcing industry. Do not use outsourcing to finally try the quantum jump that senior management has been dreaming of for quite some time. There is no issue with transforming sections of IT or the business that work with rather antiquated methods or equipment to a robust state-of-the-art solution.

Audit Reports It is a good idea to ask for an audit report from an outsourcing com  pany to get a better understanding of the security controls they have 111 Ready to Outsource implemented to protect their customers  information. However, there are many auditing standards out there, with at least three current report types and one retired one (SAS-70, retired in June 2011), so it is impor  tant to understand which one to ask for. No matter what type of report you are going to look at, it is important to understand that the reports (SOC 1 or SOC 2) represent only the opinion of an auditor and are not a certification of any kind. The only certification currently is SOC 3. Trust Services SysTrust and WebTrust The need for Trust Services, such as SysTrust and WebTrust, has grown exponentially in recent years, due to the growth of e-commerce and the overall e-business environment, resulting in large amounts of sensitive and confiden  tial data that is processed and stored by service organizations like outsourcing companies. SysTrust WebTrust audit and assurance services are a set of principles and criteria defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. Qualified or Unqualified Auditors like to use a certain lingo in their reports, which sometimes can be confusing to nonauditors. Sometimes the verbiage used comes from the early days of financial auditing and sometimes does not  stretch  to IT audits.",

For example the use of unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, and disclaimer of opinion in a report can easily be mistaken for the opposite of what they really stand for. Let s take a look at what they really mean: Unqualified opinion An unqualified opinion states that the auditor concludes that, for example, the financial statements are accurate according to the financial reporting framework used for their preparation and presentation. To clarify, an unqualified opinion is what you want to see when looking at an audit report provided by an outsourcing company. Qualified opinion On the other hand an auditor qualifying their opinion can mean that the auditor encountered one of two types of situations that deviate from generally accepted accounting principles; however, the rest of the financial state  ments are stated according to the financial reporting frame  112 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  work. A limited scope or a single deviation in a particular area of financial reporting can result in a qualified opinion. Adverse opinion This opinion is issued when the auditor deter  mines that the financial statements of an organization are mate  rially misstated and, when considered as a whole, do not conform to the financial reporting framework. An adverse opinion is considered the opposite of an unqualified or clean opinion, stating that the information gathered or provided is materially incorrect, unreliable, and inaccurate, making it impossible to assess the financial position and results of the organization. Disclaimer of opinion Commonly referred to simply as a dis  claimer, this is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to provide an opinion on the financial statements.",

Type 1 and Type 2 Reports A Type 1 report represents the auditor s opin  ion regarding the accuracy and completeness of management s descrip  tion of the system or service as well as the suitability of the design of controls as on a specific date (point-of-time audit).

SSAE 16 was issued by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in April 2010 and allows for reporting on controls 113 Ready to Outsource that are part of financial reporting of a service organization. SSAE 16 can be considered the direct successor of SAS-70 audit standard, which provided a means of reporting on internal controls over finan  cial reporting. An SSAE 16 is also sometimes referred to as an SOC 1 audit. Compared with the old SAS-70 standard, the SSAE 16 standard has an increased scope, including a baseline of controls that a service provider is required to implement. The old SAS-70 stan  dard looked only at the controls that the service provider had imple  mented. This limitation resulted in reports that could not be compared between service providers since the number of implemented controls could vary quite a bit. SOC 1 audits can be of a Type 1 or a Type 2. SOC 2 An SOC 2 audit provides much more stringent audit require  ments than an SOC 1.",

No matter what the BTO solution looks like, it will very likely require a reevaluation of the existing con  trol framework and security architecture. So what can BTO do for an organization? The answer is, it depends. It can mean that consultants will come in and analyze what you do and propose a new implementa  tion, way of doing things, with the outsourcing company implement  ing and running it. Or it can result in your solutions being replaced by 115 Ready to Outsource whatever solution is favored by the outsourcing company. In many cases it means that the outsourcing company has a strategic relationship with a vendor, promising the vendor that each transformation deal that the outsourcing company wins has a piece for the vendor in it.

Ask the Right Questions Even with transforming an antiquated solution, some confirmation from the outsourcing company should be gained that they have the necessary experience and are able to maintain the new solution. The following are questions that an outsourcing company should be able to address without stuttering: What makes up the individual components of an outsourcing solution? Can we see a list? How many individuals have been trained in the individual components? How long have those individuals been with the organization? What you will find is that outsourcing companies do not always use the cutting-edge solution (i. e. , Gartner Forrester leadership quadrant products) but rather a knock-off solution. This is to save on licensing cost. As long as the knock-off solution provider has a solid business and the solution is robust enough, this is OK. The risk is that if the business of the solution vendor is not solid, you might have to accept the next knock-off solution two years later, since the first vendor is no longer in business. Dedicated Resources or Not? Another aspect of outsourcing that needs to be understood is that most of the time you will not have dedicated resources for all services provided.",

The business model that most outsourcing companies have adopted requires that resources are always fully utilized and sometimes 116 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  even over-allocated. Unfortunately some outsourcing companies have a tendency to underbid significantly, resulting in a shortage of dedi  cated resources and not being able to support all security and com  pliance requirements of that one engagement. Usually what happens then is that resources start wearing multiple hats a problem when it comes to segregation of duties. Here is a real-life example: an analyst who was tasked to establish access for the users on the customer side is also the  independent  verifier who is tasked to check if access was correctly granted according to the approved access request. These two roles should be strictly separated from each other. Particularly when you are required to be compliant with Sarbanes Oxley or any other regulation, the shortage of resources is very likely to create a targetrich environment for auditor teams coming through.

So try to get the contacts of organizations where outsourcing activities have not gone that well.

The key to success of any business relationship is to understand what is and what is not important for the business partner. Where can I push, where do I need to go another route, and where do I need to give? Unfortunately, most business negotiations are far from having open communication. So to at least understand the business model that most outsourcing companies have in place might help you find those areas where you can push and others where the outsourcing company will not be able to accommodate you.

There are three basic principles that most outsourcing companies have to operate with: Bring down cost Initial investments and operational costs need to be brought down to achieve the margins that are tar  geted. This is achieved through bringing down labor costs. (Personnel are usually recruited in emerging countries or sometimes in rural areas that have low labor rates. India and the Philippines are just two countries that are often in the mix, but nowadays countries like Egypt are also part of the mix, maybe not as primary service providers but as secondary, i. e. , help desk service, to the main, e. g. , Indian, staff. ) Operate within acceptable business risk This is a general princi  pal all organizations operate by; however, for the outsourcing company this is especially important because many organi  zations are putting more responsibility for their business in the outsourcing company s hands. The aspect of liability is something not well understood by either side, each struggling to limit their liability and responsibility in case of an incident. This situation can quickly create business risks that the out  sourcing company would not be able to address. For this rea  son, most outsourcing agreements clearly spell out the limits of responsibilities of the outsourcing company. Those limita  tions can be the availability of the public cloud (At the time of this writing, for example, one major cloud provider does not count any outages below 5 minutes against their uptime SLA).",

The problem with those reports is that the outsourcing company provides the scope of the assessment. The internal process of granting access at the outsourcing company might be assessed; however, whether staff of the outsourcing com  pany follows your organization s process for granting access is a whole different assessment. Profit is mainly driven by more customers work Margins in the outsourcing industry are much lower than, for example, in consulting. This requires the outsourcing companies to strive to gain more customers to increase their revenue and the profit that goes along with it. This directly ties back to the first principle, bring down cost. Any specialization to the needs of a more  exotic  customer might result in lower mar  gins. Wherever possible, outsourcing companies want to go with standard offerings allowing them to reuse it with other customers. Any specialization will have a high (compared with standardized services) price tag. Challenges Outsourcing Companies Face For many people outsourcing companies present themselves as the master of all trades, bringing knowledge to the table that will pro  vide for superior results than what the client organization has ever seen before, bundled with cost savings.

In reality an engagement might have individuals that have gained the knowledge and expertise; however, most of the time this other engagement is still ongoing, and the individuals with the knowl  edge and experience are tied up. This situation gets worse since most outsourcing companies treat each outsourcing contract as a sepa  rate microcosm that needs to be cash-flow positive. This is a com  mon approach to manage risk in the outsourcing industry. This setup results in resources (i. e. , knowledge) hardly being shared across out  sourcing engagements. Even worse, if an outsourcing deal comes to an end, personnel that cannot be immediately reallocated to another 119 Ready to Outsource engagement are laid off, losing expertise and knowledge. There might be a framework that gets developed once in a while; however, looking across the industry verticals, outsourcing companies are simply over  whelmed with the number of security requirements and regulations that clients have.

The answer to this question is, it really depends. What does it depend on? The structure of the outsourcing deal is the major factor. The two extreme cases are (1) an organization stays in their building, continues to use their own equipment, and has outsourcing personnel take over the tasks, and (2) a company decides to give everything to an out  sourcing company, which then uses their own staff, in their building with their equipment to provide the service to the company.

As your organization has done a thorough identification of the threats and vulnerabilities that are applicable to the business and the way that business is conducted, those controls are very likely the right ones to leave in place.

The same holds for processes, equipment, and the outsourcing company s employees; however, a mature outsourcing company is able to offer you a solution that meets your security requirements based on what fits their environment. The dilemma with many outsourcing companies is that many of them have adopted a mode of operations in which client security requirements are implemented, even in the extreme case that every  thing is done by the outsourcing company. This is a loss for both sides since risk is very likely not properly addressed and money is not wisely spent on controls that do not address your business risk appropriately. An outsourcing company that can standardize security controls across multiple clients will have cost savings that can be passed on (at least partially) to clients. Unfortunately most outsourcing companies have only a thin layer of basic controls (e. g. , physical access to the build  ing) that is shared between clients. A standardization would require a more in-depth understanding of the industry the client belongs to, which is an investment of time and money that an industry with paper thin margins is not willing to make, for obvious reasons. Cost Savings To gain better cost savings, you should ask if the outsourcing com  pany has a security architecture and a control framework that can be used to secure your outsourced operation and serves as the foundation for a customized security architecture for your outsourcing operation.

To address the risks of your newly outsourced operation, you will need to leverage that knowledge and combine it with your specific risk to your business. Security Controls Depending on the scale of the outsourcing efforts, security controls need to be adjusted. Having outsourcing company personnel at the client site is one scenario that is often underestimated. The client can be overwhelmed, with not enough space for the outsourcing personnel to sit down, not enough network capacity, or simply not having inter  national long-distance service. The following are some of the control areas that require your attention. Physical Controls One of the most mature type of controls that keep our information and assets protected is physical controls, which have been challenged in today s world. This used to be quite straight  forward during medieval times, but even in ancient times it was not flawless.

Someone monitoring 122 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  the server room via close-captioned TV (CCTV) would suddenly see the room being occupied frequently by individuals wearing a contractor badge. The next question that might come up is how they entered the room if contractors are not allowed in the server room.

A contractor who works three months on the engagement and enters the room at least once a day has a high chance that the security guard has formed a habit of letting him in, regardless of being authorized or not.

October 2010. 40(6): 998 1009. 123 Ready to Outsource Understanding the limits of human controls and automated con  trols is important when part or the majority of an organization is outsourced. Some of those limitations are also applicable to everyday operations of an organization and might or might not get ampli  fied when outsourcing comes into the picture. Put a review of your  human  controls on the list of things that need to be reviewed before day one. Figure 4. 2 is a list of physical security controls that provide a starting point for what to review. It lists some of the physical controls and their potential shortcomings during an outsourcing situation. Please do not take this as a complete list. The list of controls was just chosen as an example of controls that require a review and potentially adjustment. Logical Security Controls Nowadays most industries are regulated and have to comply with control frameworks (e. g. , Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology  COBIT ). A major trend was set when companies like Enron or MCI-Worldcom were caught with accounting practices that overstated their profits and others not appropriately protecting personal information about customers and employees. This resulted at a federal and state level in the US that many new regulations were passed, intending to stop compa  nies from manipulating their finance statements, or in other cases ensure that private information about customers and employees was protected against unauthorized access. Particularly IT was impacted by many new logical controls that were added to the scope of their work. It is certainly another point to add to the checklist of things to address before day one.",

It is certainly another point to add to the checklist of things to address before day one. Logical controls have become a critical part of the IT infrastruc  ture, being a large cost factor with obvious and hidden costs. For that reason it is critical that the impact of the outsourcing activity on the area of logical controls is well understood. In the following chapters we will go through some of the key concerns that need to be thought through before making a decision to outsource and what type of model might work for a particular organization. Those concerns are mainly derived from a security and privacy perspective (Figure 4. 3 should not be considered a complete list). The controls listed are just examples that require a review and potentially adjustments to the outsourcing situation you are facing. 124 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  Physical Control (Example) Description Shortfall of Control during Outsourcing Locks with hard keys Individuals who require access have a hard key Most hard keys are easily copied at home improvement stores. It is very diﬃcult to ensure that keys are not copied or to even keep an inventory of all keys with changing personnel. Te risk of losing a key is very high with a large number of keys in circulation. Also the replacement cost is directly tied to the number of people having access. Cyberlocks with PIN Individuals have a PIN that they punch into a cyber lock to enter through a door.

Those technologies and processes can cost orga  nizations lots of money and are sometimes kept alive only for political reasons. Examples of such reasons are union demands, interdivisional rivalry, or a conservative decision maker. When the time comes to outsource, those become primary candidates for consolidation. Too many organizations stall when the outsourcing topic comes up. This results in standard maintenance not being performed any  more and just the bare minimum being done to continue to have IT running. More complex outsourcing engagements can sometimes take years to negotiate, resulting in staff morale being low and IT being in bad shape, such as servers running at their maximum capac  ity or patches not being applied. If you are already in such a down  ward trend, it is critical to the overall security posture to work against this trend and plan for housecleaning before the outsourcing company takes over. You should still have many of your skilled employees at that time before the outsourcing company has their personnel take on the responsibility with less-experienced personnel.

Maturity Level Many outsourcing companies have achieved ISO 9001 certifications or other certifications that demonstrate their commitment to delivering consistently high quality services to their clients. However, those certifi  cations do not necessarily mean that an outsourcing company is operating as well as it could. Inefficiencies are the biggest enemy of every organiza  tion. This is not different for outsourcing organizations. An inefficiency that was a minor problem in a small organization can become a major obstacle when the organization grows. This can be with a business pro  cess or at the human resource level by bringing on the wrong talent. An outsourcing organization s maturity level, when it comes to governance, processes, and human resources, is a critical factor in executing its client s commitments, particularly when it comes to security. Some of the out  sourcing organizations see security and compliance still as an overhead 127 Ready to Outsource that they do not properly staff for. Security tasks and responsibilities are assigned to individuals who do not have the proper background in secu  rity or privacy. This can result in significant risk to the client, who was under the impression that he received the same or better level of security service than what was in place before the outsourcing took place.

Once the outsourcing company has control of delivering security services, it will be much harder to change direc  tions or the service provided. So having the right strategy regarding how security wraps around the IT and the business services products delivered can save time and money. Be honest and point out discon  nects and deficiencies. Different organizations have chosen different approaches of how security is integrated into the organization. Many efforts have been undertaken to synchronize and connect those models. However, at the current time none have reached a maturity level that would allow providing the reader with a recommendation of what is the right approach. The reality might be that there are different approaches that work for different organizations. Below are some questions that can help you determine if your security program does the right things when it comes to defining and executing your security strategy: Do you have access to the IT strategy or the business strategy? Is security part of the development of the IT strategy?

Modern organizations have such a complex mesh of business processes that are sometimes so tightly interwoven that it is nearly impossible just to transform security processes by themselves. Security outsourcing has been limited to certain services that are offered, e. g. , vulnerabil  ity scanning. When transforming major areas of business processes, security processes also need to be included in that transformation with the risk that the new security process does not easily integrate with the remaining legacy security processes, e. g. , certain KPI are no longer available. The outsourcing company usually has a huge interest in optimizing processes to bring down the cost associated with them; this is no different from security-related processes. This optimization is not always in the interest of the client, since it sometimes results in elements of a process being lost due to a lack of documentation. Documentation, or to be more precise, accurate and current docu  mentation is one of the key factors to successful outsourcing.

Comments Questions: The following questions should help to determine if changes need to be made to address the new out  sourcing situation: Do the policies scale to a third party executing them?

    "content": "Do you have problem areas with the organization of infor  mation security? How would those problems complicate the transition to the outsourcing company? External Parties  Security Description: Risks to the organization s information and infor  mation processing facility, from a process involving external party access, is identified and appropriate control measures are implemented before granting access. All identified secu  rity requirements are fulfilled before granting customer access to the organization s information or assets. Any agreement with a third party, involving accessing, processing, communi  cating, or managing the organization s information or infor  mation processing facility, or introducing products or services to an information processing facility, needs to comply with all appropriate security requirements. Comments: Particularly with large outsourcing engagements the areas above can be impacted by the outsourcing company taking on responsibilities that could impact the neutrality of the processes. Questions: Is the independence of all areas of this category still ensured when the outsourcing company has taken on some of the responsibilities? How does the involvement of an outsourcing company impact third-party relationships (e. g. , other partners or customers)? 131 Ready to Outsource Information Classification Security Description: Information is classified in terms of its value, legal requirements, sensitivity, and criticality to the organization. Procedures are defined for information labeling and han  dling, in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the organization. Comments: This is another critical area in an outsourcing situ  ation. The outsourcing company will not bring the tribal knowledge that your organization used to determine how to secure certain information (e. g. , without proper label). Questions: Do you have an information classification scheme in place? Is it current?",

Employees, contrac  tors, and third-party users are required to sign confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements as a part of their initial terms and conditions of the employment contract. The agreements should cover the information security responsibility of the organization and that of the employees, third-party users, and contractors.

Comments: The outsourcing company s personnel should be included in the scope of the processes and standards in this category. Besides the outsourcing company bringing on staff to help transition the operation, your organization also has to deal with layoffs of sometimes longtime employees. Questions: Does management understand the impact of mass layoffs? Do they support additional security measures? Is the security awareness training suitable for third par  ties (outsourcing personnel), and is it still usable after the outsourcing transition has been completed? In the light of being laid off, does the disciplinary process still work, or are employees without any discipline? Termination or Change-of-Employment Security Description: The responsibilities for performing employment ter  mination, or change of employment, are clearly defined and assigned.

Entry controls are in place to allow only authorized per  sonnel into various areas within the organization. Rooms that have the information processing service are locked or have lockable cabinets or safes.

However, in July 2012 northern India had over 600 million people without electricity. The data center at the off  shore location might be still up but the personnel maintaining it might not be able to come to work. This is just one example of how a situation with the outsourced operation can impact the operation of your  new  organization. Another aspect to keep in mind is that when the transition activities start, with 134 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  many outsourcing personnel running around in your facilities, you will need to have implemented measures to ensure that your physical access security level stays intact. This could be as easy as making a decision to create a new special badge type for outsourcing personnel that has access excluded to areas that are off-limits for outsourcing personnel. Loading docks and other areas that provide access to the premises should have increased security, e. g. , additional CCTV monitoring, to ensure that not everything gets transitioned. Questions: In the case of the outsourcing scope including IT collo  cation or consolidation, do your physical security policies and standards map to the new facilities, do the physical standards need to be adjusted, or are the physical security standards of the outsourcing company sufficient?",

Comments: If your organization is weak in this area, you will have issues in successfully outsourcing all or parts of your operation. Questions: Does your organization have a robust and scalable capac  ity performance monitoring approach in place? 139 Ready to Outsource   Can this approach be used to monitor systems outside the company-owned data center? If the outsourcing company does its own monitoring, can it be fed into your company s monitoring system? How is this performance data used during planning of new systems? Can the outsourcing company offer something that is comparable or even better? What is the new process for system acceptance, once the outsourcing company has taken on the task of deploying systems? Protection against Malicious and Mobile Code Security Description: Detection, prevention, and recovery controls to pro  tect against malicious code and appropriate user awareness procedures were developed and implemented. Only autho  rized mobile code is used. The configuration ensures that authorized mobile code operates according to security policy. Execution of unauthorized mobile code is prevented. Comments: One would think that in this millennium malicious code protection is a standard with all organizations. Still there are organizations without any malicious and or mobile code protection in place. Questions: What are your controls against malicious code? Do you have an enterprise-level solution? Are there any issues with the existing solution that might be magnified or potentially even prevent a third party (i. e. , outsourcing personnel) from using the existing solu  tion outside the corporate network? Is the plan to have the outsourcing personnel use their own systems on the corporate network? A risk assessment of the configuration should be conducted.",

Network Security Management Security Description: The network is adequately managed and controlled to protect from threats and to maintain security for the systems and applications using the network, including the informa  tion in transit. Controls were implemented to ensure the secu  rity of the information in networks and the protection of the connected services from threats, such as unauthorized access. 141 Ready to Outsource Security features, service levels, and management requirements of all network services are identified and included in any net  work services agreement. The ability of the network service pro  vider to manage agreed services in a secure way is determined and regularly monitored, and the right to audit is agreed upon. Comments: Network security is one of the traditional security disciplines that have reached a high maturity level in many regards. The more widespread adoption of IPv6 has been a game changer for some organizations and potentially created a situation where expertise is missing in house, resulting in security vulnerabilities. Questions: What version of IP does your network use? Is your network adequately monitored, or do you feel you have gaps? What happens if you allow the outsourcing company to put their equipment, e. g. , laptops, on your network? Does the antivirus protection of those devices work with yours?

Can the devices be managed securely; e. g. , SNMPv3 is implemented with authentication? Are you collecting metrics that can be used to measure against any agreed on SLAs?",

Media-Handling Security Description: Procedures exist for management of removable media, such as tapes, disks, cassettes, memory cards, and reports. All procedures and authorization levels are clearly defined and documented. Media that are no longer required are disposed of securely and safely, as per formal procedures. A procedure exists for handling information storage. These procedures address issues such as information protection from unauthorized disclosure or misuse. System documentation is protected against unauthorized access. 142 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  Comments: Particularly media handling is an area that is under  valued in importance in today s world that is living in the teraand exabyte storage sizes. A loss of a small USB drive can result in a major lawsuit. Modern USB drives can easily fit the names and Social Security numbers of every US citizen. Questions: Do you have formalized processes in place that state how removable media are handled? What type of removable media do you have? Are you hanging onto outdated technologies (e. g. , QIC80 tapes) because a critical system relies on it? Have you defined an exit strategy to replace this outdated technology? It will be costly to have the outsourcing company take this over and maintain it. The not-so-costly alternative is to have the outsourcing company transition the backup to a modern solution; however, the cheapest solution is to do it yourself before transitioning it over. Have you thought about how media can be securely destroyed? What is the current process, and what are the require  ments? Are they still valid, or are there new requirements that would require a new process?",

Electronic Commerce Services Security Description: The information involved in electronic commerce passing over the public network is protected from fraudulent activity, contract dispute, and any unauthorized access or modification. Security controls such as application of cryp  tographic controls are taken into consideration. Electronic commerce arrangements between trading partners require a documented agreement, which commits both parties to the agreed terms of trading, including details of security issues. Information involved in online transactions is protected to prevent incomplete transmission, misrouting, unauthorized message alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized message duplication, or replay. The integrity of the publicly available information is protected against any unauthorized modification. Comments: Most organizations nowadays have electronic com  merce as part of their business strategy. Ensuring the security of the data, the confidentiality, the integrity, the availabil  ity, and the nonrepudiation are the foundation of electronic commerce. To ensure those attributes stay in place after the outsourcing company has taken on the operation of the elec  tronic commerce systems can be a critical element of success of the initiative or even become a question of survival of an organization if the electronic commerce is the main revenue stream. Online transactions nowadays can be checked for geographic locations. Even with the same IP (which is not very likely if you have the outsourcing organization physically move your IT equipment to their data center), you can experi  ence problems with online transactions of trade partners that have those additional safeguards in place.",

This is also true for the data classification. In most cases a client will ask to have their own policies and standards implemented with systems that are now maintained by the outsourcing company s personnel. So where is the problem? The problem is that due to the out  sourcing company s executing, processes need to be adopted and standards on the outsourcing company side need to be established to support the client s policies. For example, this can start with physical security since the outsourcing person  nel and the outsourced servers are now in a building that is compliant with the outsourcing companies  physical security requirements, not necessarily the client ones. Since those buildings are shared between engagements, this might result in an interesting situation in that one client requires a specific set of physical controls and another client requires a differ  ent set. In the worst case, the two sets contradict each other. Most outsourcing companies are real estate poor, meaning real estate is bought when a client deal goes through. Another example is how personnel are brought on or rolled off an engagement. These processes and standards need to be devel  oped for each outsourcing engagement. Unfortunately, this requirement is not well understood by either the outsourcing company or auditors coming from the client side.

How is log information protected? Can log information be protected even after the IT opera  tion is outsourced? How are administrator and operator logs handled today? What needs to be done to ensure that the actions of out  sourcing personnel working as administrators or operators are monitored and the audit logs cannot be manipulated by the outsourcing personnel? Are system or application faults logged? What is the process to analyze for root causes of faults? Does the fault analysis process still work after the out  sourcing is put in place? Are clocks of IT devices synchronized? If you are in just one location, you might have the clocks set to local time. When going with an internationally operating outsourc  ing company, you might be up for a sweet surprise when reviewing logs for the first time.",

Logical and physical access controls are taken into consideration in the policy. The users and service providers are given a clear state  ment of the business requirement to be met by access controls. Comments: Access control design is driven by the overarching policy and the standards that are supporting the policy. With an outsourcing situation, those standards very likely require adjustments, potentially even the policy itself requires a review and update. Questions: Are your access control policy, processes, and standards up to date? Do you review the access policy, processes, and standards on at least an annual basis? What is the plan to adjust the access controls when the IT operation is outsourced? Are logical and physical aspects covered? How are logical and physical controls impacted by the planned outsourcing engagement? Are the business requirements addressed in the current solution? If the business needs are not met by the current solution, what can be done in conjunction with the outsourcing company to get better alignment? A solution that might have been too expensive might now be in reach through the outsourcing company s volume discounts.",

User Access Management Security Description: There is a formal user registration and deregistration procedure for granting access to all information systems and services. The allocation and use of any privileges in an informa  tion system environment are restricted and controlled; i. e. , priv  ileges are allocated on a need-to-know basis, with privileges being granted only after a formal authorization process. The 149 Ready to Outsource allocation and reallocation of passwords are controlled through a formal management process, and users are required to sign a statement to keep the password confidential. A process is in place for the review of user access rights at regular intervals. Comments: How access is granted will very likely have to change with an outsourcing company having many personnel taking on roles that were traditionally held internally to the orga  nization. References to job titles in the policies or standards might not match anymore when it comes to roles that approve or review access. This is another area of concern that needs to be clearly spelled out in the contract with the outsourc  ing company. The importance and the level of effort that are required to restructure the actors in the access control pro  cesses are easily underestimated and can be the source for many audit findings.",

User Responsibilities Security Description: There are security practices in place to guide users in selecting and maintaining secure passwords. The users and contractors are made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting unattended equipment. A clear desk policy with regard to papers and removable storage media has been adopted. The organization has adopted clear screen pol  icy with regard to information processing facility. Comments: With the outsourcing activities very likely resulting in new systems and new processes being needed, it is critical to ensure that password safety is still at the right level i. e. , users, regardless of whether they are employees or personnel of the outsourcing company, are required to use strong passwords. If this is an issue at the current point in time, it will just get ampli  fied when the outsourcing company has taken over systems. Questions: Are you doing the right things now? Do you have gaps?

Do you have an unattended equipment security standard in place that clearly spells out how the workstations and servers are protected (e. g. , screen savers turn on after a certain amount of time and require a login to continue users  sessions).

Network Access Control Security Description: Users are provided with access only to the services that they have been specifically authorized to use. A policy exists that does address concerns relating to networks and network services. Appropriate authentication mechanisms are used to control access by remote users. Automatic equip  ment identification (where available) is being used as a means to authenticate connections from specific locations and equipment. Physical and logical access to diagnostic ports are securely controlled, for example, protected by a security mechanism. Groups of information services, users, and infor  mation systems are segregated on networks. The network that business partners and or third parties use to access their infor  mation system is segregated using perimeter security mecha  nisms such as firewalls. Consideration is made for segregation of wireless networks from internal and private networks. An access control policy exists which states network connection control for shared networks, especially for those that extend across the organization s boundaries. The access control policy states routing controls are to be implemented for networks.",

Comments: There are many roads that lead to Rome, and this is also true for securing a system or even an organization. I have seen organizations that prefer the fingerprint reader, others prefer passwords, and some prefer hardware tokens to log in to their workstations. So when you get personnel from the outsourcing company onsite that connect to your network, you might see that they are using a different means of authen  tication to access the outsourcing company s systems that are used to deliver service to your organization. This form of authentication might or might not be in compliance with your policies and standards. If the access methods do not increase your risk level, it would be advisable to adjust your standards. Most people might just say this is an exception and does not require any change of the standard. Once you open up the floodgates of exceptions for a long-term relationship like the one that you have with an outsourcing company, you will eas  ily drown in exceptions, quickly getting to a point where you do not understand your organization s real security posture anymore.

However, if you outsource the majority of IT, you will very likely have a problem with your existing workflow since now outsourcing personnel are in the roles that used to sign off on the access. For the majority of access that might be OK; for some access you will want to have someone from your organization to sign off and provide oversight to the process. Just to show that the devil is in the details, having a manager from the outsourcing company sign off on access to reports that were created to evaluate the outsourcing company might not be a good idea. If you have systems that contain sensitive infor  mation, they very likely require additional security measures such as network segregation by putting them on a separate net  work and dedicated computing equipment.

It might be a good idea to spend some time understanding what is offered and if it is better than what you have in-house. Cryptographic Controls Security Description: The organization has a policy on use of cryptographic controls for protection of information. A key management is in place to support the organization s use of cryptographic techniques, ensuring that cryptographic keys are protected against modification, loss, and destruction. Secret keys and private keys are protected against unauthorized disclosure. Equipments used to generate and store keys are physically protected. The key management system is based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure methods. Comments: Cryptography is, nowadays, kind of the silver bul  let, when it comes to ensuring confidentiality or the integrity of sensitive information. Unfortunately there is a shortage of skilled people who understand key management and encryp  tion standards in the software development community, which sometimes results in solutions that have the devil in the details. A prime example is database encryption that is  sold  as the silver bullet, addressing all encryption requirements. The data  base encryption becomes pointless in the case of applicationbased attacks, where the database allows certain user groups to access the data in a transparent fashion, i. e. , the information is available in clear text to an attacker of the application that uses the data.",

If processes are not defined and or security controls are missing to ensure that the operational produc  tion environment s integrity stays intact, then moving this to an outsourcing company will just increase the problem. The tribal knowledge that is very likely used to avoid major prob  lems when informally moving code into production is not there with the new personnel. Documenting the process and also implementing the right level of security controls will not only help the outsourcing personnel to do the right thing; it will also ensure that when you get audited the auditors have a good feeling about how your operational environment is protected against intentional or unintentional changes. Testing of new code should never been done with production data. However it is common practice that developers require production data either to fix a certain bug in the code or to simply do their testing. As long as this production data is properly protected, then this practice imposes just a minimal risk. Unfortunately in most of the cases this is not the case; traditionally development environments are way less secure than the production envi  ronment. Thumb drives being used to transfer data from one developer machine to another are not unusual. As long as this is done internally by your staff, you kind of have control over it. Once a development team from an outsourcing company takes 164 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  on the development, the problems might get much bigger.

The development team is just concerned with fixing a problem, not knowing that they just had downloaded healthcare information about US citizens to their laptop which was specifically spelled out in the outsourcing contract as data that could not leave the United States, might put you in a dif  ficult situation. The situation gets worse when developers are shared between clients of the outsourcing company, potentially using your data for testing with another client s application. All the scenarios described have been observed in outsourced environments, not speaking of the countless thumb drives that have been lost over the years. What applies to data also applies to source code; being shared via thumb drives, it is not unusual that source code is being lost. Another risk with this practice is that developers have the tendency to keep a copy of the code they just developed, so they can reuse it in the future. If you have not invested time and money into securing system files, now is the time before the problems get even bigger due to missing security controls (e. g. , Tripwire).

Security in Development and Support Services Description: Strict control procedures are in place to control imple  mentation of changes to the information system. These proce  dures address the need for risk assessment and impact analysis. There is a process in place to review and test business-critical applications for adverse impact on organizational operations or security after the change to operating systems. Modifications to software packages are discouraged and or limited to neces  sary changes. There are controls in place to prevent information leakage. Controls such as scanning of outbound media, regu  lar monitoring of personnel and system activities permitted 165 Ready to Outsource under local legislation, or monitoring resource usage have been implemented. Outsourced software development is supervised and monitored by the organization. Comments: The change control process is an area that will be stretched to the maximum during the transition time. To have a scalable process that can handle the volume of changes and the kind of changes that outsourcing an IT operation intro  duces is imperative to the success of the outsourcing initiative. Questions: Has the change control process been documented? Is the change control process always followed or are there exceptions (e. g. , emergency changes)? Does the existing process scale up to include the outsourc  ing company s services provided to the organization? Areas of interest are e. g. , conference lines, can they been dialed-in from a foreign country, and are the change control meetings at times where locations with different time zones are operating?

As part of the outsourcing deal you might be planning on a tech  nology refresher, which usually means for servers and workstations an upgrade to a new operating system (OS). This can easily result in your organization coming to a screeching halt if done wrong. Even testing in virtual environments is no guarantee that the new OS is not going to cripple critical business applications on the server or workstation. Testing on a server might be even easier than at a workstation, if your organization has a testing environment that really mirrors production. However organizations are usually short on servers in their test envi  ronment due to multiple activities taking place at the same time. This results in the interesting situation of one project requiring an exact copy of the production environment to do their testing before deploy  ing to production and another one trying to upgrade the OS and hav  ing to test it in the test environment first before going to production. 166 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services    What is your organization s stand on changes to software packages?

Too many outsourcing deals go bad simply due to the client trying to get the maximum cost sav  ings. Nothing is free. Thinking you can save 50 percent of your last year s operational budget is simply not realistic, particularly if you expect the same level of quality.

Technical Vulnerability Management Security Description: Timely information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems is being obtained. The organization s exposure to such vulnerabilities is evaluated and appropriate measures are taken to mitigate the associated risk. Comments: Software vendors have been overwhelmed with zero-day exploits, meaning the vulnerability becomes public 167 Ready to Outsource knowledge and at the same time hacker tools become avail  able to exploit the vulnerability. Due to the dependency of vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, or other big software vendors it is nearly impossible for an organization to fix the vulner  ability themselves. Questions: How does your organization handle zero-day vulnerabili  ties or address vulnerabilities in general? The best you can do is a work-around or turn the vulnerable service  application off until the vendor provides a patch. With browser vul  nerabilities making up a majority of discovered vulnerabilities, it is sometimes impossible to implement any work-around. How fast can your organization identify vulnerable systems? Does your organization have processes in place on how to address such vulnerabilities? What is the SLA that the outsourcing company has provided you regarding patching? Is it realistic? Does it address zeroday vulnerability situations? If your answer is  no  or  unknown  to any of the questions above, you might want to get a better understanding of how the outsourcing com  pany handles such situations, whether they can provide some metrics on how fast they patch, and how they address zero-day exploits vul  nerabilities.",

Reporting Information Security Events and Weaknesses Security Description: Information security events are reported through appro  priate management channels as quickly as possible. Appropriate reporting procedure, incident response, and escalation proce  dure have been developed and implemented. A procedure exists 168 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  that ensures that all employees of information systems and ser  vices are required to note and report any observed or suspected security weakness in the system or services. Comments: Reporting security events is a critical process that not only drives the remediation efforts to a security event but also allows for collection of metrics that later are used to deter  mine if measures investments into information security have shown the success that was expected when they were first put in place. Questions: Does your organization s security event monitoring use industry standard technology or is it a homegrown solution? If the solution is a homegrown solution, it very likely does not scale up to an outsourcing situation. Are you ready to invest in a new solution? Do your processes around security event notification and handling scale up to the new outsourcing situation?",

Depending on what outsourcing model the outsourcing company is proposing (e. g. , foreign countries as location for your data), you will have to work with your legal department on determining if this is a feasible model. Even if it is legally feasible, the question comes up regarding how data breaches are handled in that country or what rights the local government has in that country. Many organiza  tions quickly forget that outsourcing companies go to low cost coun  tries that sometimes are less than stable, economically or politically. Certain governments have laws in place that allow them to spy on any communication taking place in their country, even the ones that are encrypted, e. g. , Indian government putting pressure on Research in Motion (RIM), the manufacturer of the BlackBerry devices, to pro  vide the encryption keys, so communication to BlackBerrys in India can be eavesdropped on. After 4 years of RIM refusing to hand over the keys, it finally provided a partial solution to the Indian government in August 2012 which allows the Indian government to eavesdrop on any encrypted communication between personal BlackBerry users in India. This solution is not exactly what the Indian government had asked for. The Indian government is actually trying to eavesdrop on corporate communication. Some might think that it is more interested in capturing some of the trade secrets that go back and forth between the corporate BlackBerry users than actually finding information that helps to fight terrorism. Fighting terrorism was actually used as the primary reason by the Indian government when it asked for the encryption keys.",

If the auditor asks for a data classification standard, the outsourcing company will very likely provide the internal standard that is used for the outsourcing company s internal operation; however, it is not very likely applicable to the outsourcing engagement, which contains data of the client organization (what holds for poli  cies, standards and processes also holds for data classification. One needs to be established at the engagement level). This situation creates a crooked picture of what is being done and what is required to be done. The auditors will use the cli  ent s organization s data classification and map it to the IT system maintained at the outsourcing organization, to get a proper picture of the security controls and if they have been sufficiently addressed by the outsourcing company.

Having said that, it should be obvious that your audit systems in the hand of the outsourcing company s personnel creates an awkward situation. If the answers to the questions below already indicate a problem with your current practice, then you should fix those issues before turning over the IT systems that are having the problems. Questions: Has management approved the requirements and scope of an audit? 180 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services    Is access to information system audit tools such as soft  ware or data files protected to prevent any possible misuse or compromise? Are information system audit tools separated from devel  opment and operational systems, unless given an appro  priate level of additional protection? Outsourcing Security Readiness Assessment Now that you know what areas to address, the next step is to deter  mine the outsourcing maturity levels of those areas. The following describes an assessment process that uses a five level scale to rate the maturity of the security areas previously described. The assessment uses four aspects for a final rating. Process Execution How is the process executed? Is the process documented and the documentation well maintained? Are skilled resources available? Process Input Is the input for the process documented and well understood, or are inputs not defined and the documen  tation has not been maintained?",

Having more areas in  good shape  should result in a smoother transition and a shorter time to come to a normal level of outsourcing operations. Everyone that has gone through a large-scale outsourcing transition can attest that knowledge is the key to a suc  cessful transition. Well-documented mature processes are no excep  tion to that rule. Relying on employees who know that they are going to be laid off is usually not a good idea. Between low morale and the time crunch that the outsourcing activities will create, you will find that most  tribal knowledge  is not passed on to the outsourcing orga  nization. By the time you find out that a process is broken due to lack of knowledge, it is usually too late since the employee with the exper  tise is no longer with the company. Particularly with security heavy processes, this can have a significant impact on the overall security posture. Once the external auditors have taken a closer look at the situation, you will know for sure. Tactical Goals Now or Later? Most organization think that when they outsource part or all of the operations, it might be a good time for the implementation of some of the tactical goals which have been on the book for quite some time. If those goals are still aligned with the overall strategic direction, then they should be included in the scope of the outsourcing initiative. However, an analysis should take place for each of them to check if they are still valid.",

Examples for tactical goals that make good candidates are security awareness training, management of physical security, access management. If you noticed you have issues with what you currently have in place, then those areas should be evaluated. Strategic Objectives When? Lately there has been a shift in thinking of what makes up the right security measures to allow for the best investment of resources, miti  gating high risk areas that are not acceptable to the organization. The 183 Ready to Outsource traditional approach of the castle with solid walls to keep the bad guys out is long gone. Many corporations have a large number of employ  ees with a mobile workforce using smartphones, laptops and iPads to access corporate systems, reading e-mails, accessing sensitive corporate information from their mobile devices. The next challenge has already arrived in the form of BYOD and the cloud, which has resulted in many cloud-based value-added services, where the sky seems to be the limit. Depending on the agility of your organization s business, the IT and security strategies are being reviewed and updated more than once a year.

The best example for this is General Electric (GE) a pioneer of outsourcing, which is now bringing its manufacturing back in-house. Another well-known name is General Motors (GM), bring  ing its whole IT back in-house, after years of having it outsourced. The questions of total cost of ownership (TCO) sometimes also called Total Cost of Outsourcing is in most cases underestimated, and par  ticularly the cost for additional security that needs to be put in place to address the outsourcing situation is in most cases not well understood before the outsourcing deal is put in place. The outsourcing company is in most cases not very knowledgeable about a particular regula  tion that an industry needs to be compliant with. For that reason the approach that is chosen by the outsourcing company to implement the security controls that are required by a regulation are sometimes not implemented as intended by the entity that oversees the regulation.

Yes, there is always opportunity to save money. However, going with the elusive percent  age of savings that some outsourcing organizations present to their customers is simply foolish. You will soon realize that there are other areas you have to invest in, to ensure that your organization can oper  ate smoothly. Sometimes the attitude outsourcing companies take toward risk is not really the same as what your organization would take. The challenge now is to find the right level of control to ensure that your organization gets the service it is entitled to.

The time can vary depending on the size of the outsourcing deal or the complexity of service provided. The issues will range from small, requiring slight corrections that are handled informally, to major conflicts in which lawyers put the contract under the magnifying glass to determine what was actually agreed on or, better said, the legal interpretation of what both sides agreed on.

Usually when this is recognized, it is too late and the outsourcing has been in place for a number of months, some  times years, leaving you exposed for quite some time. Auditors are used to asking a standard set of questions, for example, based on the ISO 27000 series. Unfortunately, standards like that are written for organizations that operate IT as part of conducting a business, and outsourcing IT is not the business itself. As previously discussed (see Chapter 1, Typical Financial Outsourcing Model) most outsourcing companies create separate financial entities with larger outsourcing deals, addressing the business risks of the outsourcing engagement failing. Those entities can still be part of the outsourcing company and sometimes they are separate legal entities that are owned by the outsourcing company. This results in a certain independence that is usually reflected in processes, standards, and policies. The actual out  sourcing company s standards and policies usually do not cover e. g. , how personal health information needs to be handled, since it is not part of their internal operation. Those new entities now are chal  lenged to either adopt the client s standards or come up with their own standard, which is tailored to the outsourced environment. This can create gaps that are difficult to understand and to discover (if you do not deal with it on a day-to-day basis and just conduct an audit, this might be overlooked). This setup can also result in a situation where the outsourcing company has policies, standards, and processes that cover e. g. , financial reports for the outsourcing company.",

    "content": "There are certain connections to the outsourcing company like the reporting of financials, security training, or other requirements that employees of the outsourcing company need to conduct as part of their responsibilities; however, those are in addition to what they need to do to address the client requirements. Here is an example: The outsourcing company does not have an antifraud training in place. The client is a financial organization that requires that everyone working with the financial systems undergo an antifraud training. The right way to address it is to have the outsourcing personnel that work on the engagement to attend the client s antifraud training. To address this, management of the engagement on the outsourcing company side needs to create a policy that requires outsourcing personnel to attend the training that the client offers on an agreed-upon interval. This is just for outsourcing personnel that serve that particular client and are working with the financial systems of the client. When audi  tors, tasked by the financial client, ask the outsourcing company if they have an antifraud training, the outsourcing company should ref  erence the policy that was put in place for that particular engagement, which requires that outsourcing personnel who access the financial systems of that particular client have to undergo the client-provided training at certain intervals, e. g. , once a year. Unfortunately, auditors look at this microcosm the same way they would at a whole organi  zation. This results in policies referenced that are at an outsourcing company corporate level and do not really match up with what the engagement is required to do to ensure, for example, the security of certain information. Another example is a bank that decides to outsource its mort  gage business.",

Adequate severance pay, assistance in finding a new job, or even asking the outsourcing company to hire those employees can help to keep valuable informa  tion available. In most cases they will just move on and find a new opportunity. However, in some cases the individual will react unpro  fessionally or even aggressively. Since this behavior is very difficult to predict, it is best to take precautions to prepare for the worst case, or at least for some not so typical risk situations, triggered by new threats. For example, employees with laptops might not return those devices on their last day of employment. Or they might have backups on their own personal computers at home. To address such situations, you need to start thinking about those risks early on. Hopefully your organization already has something in place that helps with the situ  ation and goes beyond just full disk encryption. Full disk encryption with a laptop protects the information stored on the laptop after a theft or if the device was lost, but not when a former authorized user can still use their password to access the information on the laptop. In this case a remote kill-switch or a remote wiping capability is required. This is one of the many scenarios you could be facing. Another aspect 190 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  to consider is backups. Even with your remote workforce you want to keep this under control.

Since the invention of the laptop, this has been a problem; to secure backup for modern laptops with gigabytes of data of employees that spent most of their time on the road.

Having a user responsible for their own backup can bring various problems with it. A backup drive that is not encrypted and is stored in the user s laptop bag, right next to the laptop with full disk encryption, might defeat the purpose of the full disk encryption. However, the more concerning part is that your organization will lose complete control over the information if you allow personal backup solutions. Corporate data should stay on corporate systems. It is not feasible to expect that the police will search someone s home just because of a suspicion that there might (or might not) be a portable hard drive with sensitive corporate information on it. Transition Phase The transition phase will be a difficult time. Employees who suspect that they are going to be laid off or, if lucky, are going to become part of the outsourcing company s team have to work hand in hand with the outsourcing personnel to transition their responsibilities over to the outsourcing company s personnel.

The Stable Years Eventually, if you have not decided to part before, you will have reached a level of maturity in the relationship with the outsourcing company where you feel that things are going well. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met; security and privacy requirements are addressed. Now is the time to check to see if the original exit strat  egy still works: can the organization get out of the outsourcing deal within reasonable time and resources?

If you suddenly see a sharp drop in security incidents, this can be a good or a bad sign. If this happens, it is a good first step to investigate the 192 Managing Risk in Outsourcing IT Services  contract with the outsourcing company.

One requires immediate notification if there is the potential of a security incident; the other one allows the outsourcing company to investigate and determine if the situation is a false positive.",

However, it also provides them with the freedom to determine if they have enough information on an incident or not, potentially delaying notification. The outsourcing company might never get to a point that they feel that it is an incident and you may never hear about the situation. Another aspect of security is the definition of an incident itself. Many contracts do not truly define what makes up a security inci  dent. If the outsourcing company does not use the same definition of sensitive information and the contract does not clearly spell out what sensitive information is, the following definition, without any further clarification, allows the outsourcing company to take control: In case of unauthorized access to sensitive information, the vendor is required to notify company XYZ.

Some activities might be applicable to your outsourcing activities; others might not be applicable. Access Recertification (Annual) There are two types of access recerti  fication: the logical access to IT systems and the physical security access. Both should be conducted at least annualy. In the beginning of the outsourcing relationship these reports can be as frequent as every two months. In any case, access recertification should be done at least annually if not more often. The report should contain the name and potentially the personnel number of the individual that has access, what access the individual has, why the access was granted, and who initially approved the access. Usually this could be the supervisor and the owner of the resource; e. g. , manager (outsourcing company) and system owner (client) who is recertifying that the access is still needed (outsourcing company or client).

To ensure that the system is operating and main  tained to client standards, the outsourcing company should establish engagement specific standards and policies that reflect the security requirements that the client has and are adjusted to the outsourcing company s environment (e. g. , physical location security and data cen  ter security). This won t be a one-to-one copying of the client security standards and policies, since those have been tailored to the client s own environment or situation (e. g. , different physical security, loca  tion faces different environmental threats). Those engagement-level policies and standards should be reviewed and updated as needed, or at least on an annual basis.",

This extreme change in direction will let you find out quickly if you have made mistakes during negotiations of the contract or when implementing the processes and standards supporting the outsourc  ing situation. How to Prepare Before an organization can even think about leaving an outsourcing deal, several things need to be considered and certain plans need to be developed and put in place. Some of them need to be put in place even before day one of the outsourcing deal, such as the contractual framework. Others are driven by an analysis of the current state of the outsourcing deal, providing input to the drafting of a plan that defines the changes that will ensure the secure transition of information and systems back to the organization or to another outsourcing company. The Contract Every outsourcing contract should not only address how an outsourc  ing relationship is structured during normal operations, but also needs to define the hand-over to the outsourcing company and the hand-over from the outsourcing company back to your organization or another outsourcing company. Without agreed-on terms every step can become a major exercise. All too often organizations that have decided to outsource think about the good times and the normal mode of operations but forget to define their exit strategy. Putting the requirements, processes, and supporting legal verbiage for the exit in the contract is critical to the successful execution of your exit strategy.

Analysis of What Needs to Be Done One of the first steps after an organization has decided to leave an out  sourcing deal is to review the exit strategy and update it as needed. Does the strategy still hold, or has the organization and or the relationship with the outsourcing company changed to a level that the exit strategy and the related contractual agreements no longer serve their purpose? If the answer is yes, then this needs to be revisited and necessary changes need to be made sooner rather than later. This will definitively tip off the outsourcing company, and the cooperation might deteriorate. In any case this is the foundation for all of the following steps. If the strategy and the contractual agreements are still valid, then you can start updating your exit plan. Exit Plan The exit plan contains not only technical details but also detailed steps on how information, business processes, and equipment are transi  tioned back to the organization. This exit plan can be very compre  hensive, and this book is not intended to provide instructions on how to create such a plan but rather to point out what security and privacy aspects need to be covered in such a plan. As a general rule, whatever was done during the transition by the outsourcing company can be used as a starting point for the definition of processes that can be used to exit the outsourcing relationship. The exit plan should ensure that the following requirements are addressed: At any given point of time, information security and processes ensure the compliance with any applicable law and or regulation.",

One area that is over  looked many times is the fact that outsourcing personnel, particularly when the outsourcing deal has been in place for many years, become more and more involved in the client s business, which also results in e-mails with client information or other client information being on their laptops, workstations, or mobile devices. To ensure that those devices or services (e. g. , e-mail) are wiped or at least cleaned might become a major issue. Particularly Microsoft Outlook, with its way of archiving e-mails to the local file system or in the best case to a shared drive, can create situations where it is impossible to have only clientrelated e-mails deleted from the devices or archives. To not even allow e-mails to go between the two organizations that are not related to administrative matters of the outsourcing deal might be a good idea. Providing the outsourcing personnel with e-mail accounts on the cli  ent side that are backed up to the client organization s backup solution 203 When We Part has been one way to address this situation that has quite some poten  tial for information leakage.",

Taking Control Now the day has come and you are no longer depending on an out  sourcing company, or maybe you are in a new outsourcing relation  ship. In any case, you want to make sure that you understand what you got back from the previous outsourcing organization. You could be in for a surprise. Depending on how carefully the contract was worded, the former outsourcing company might not have notified you about certain matters or might not even have executed certain tasks since they were never spelled out in the contract. This happens more often than one would expect. There have been contracts that had the whole security incident part missing. When you have a better picture of what you inherited, you can cre  ate your plan to fix those deficiencies that potentially have created a situation, which requires legal to review the findings and advise senior management on the right course of action. A deficiency that results in your no longer being in compliance with regulations and laws can easily create a huge financial liability for the organization. To then go back to the former outsourcing organization might not be the worst idea but also not the best option. Ultimately your organization needs to be in compliance, and not having checked if the outsourcing com  pany performs the required compliance tasks, is still the responsibility of your organization. Taking control also means that you need to have the right staff to execute all the tasks that the former outsourcing company performed for you. The next couple of weeks and months will show if this is the case.",

Sometimes those things make good material for lessons learned; other times it is material that shows how the complexity of a global delivery model can have a disastrous impact on someone s business. The following anecdotes either have been shared by acquaintances and friends or have been collected from various news sources. Any resemblance to actual people, events, or organizations I have worked with is purely coincidental.

In this situation the lack of appropriate security and risk management destroyed the idea of having a centralized health record system in the UK, which would have allowed a healthcare provider to gain access to the health information of individuals in case of an emergency. The confidence of the public has been lost and is nearly impossible to restore.

On January 20, 2008, the national Indian newspaper The Hindu announced a transportation strike in Bangalore, one of the leading locations in India for outsourcing activities. This strike was triggered, according to the newspaper, by dispute over  speed-governing devices  that had to be installed in the vehicles. Even though not all transpor  tation companies participated in the strike, it had a major impact on some of the outsourcing service providers and their customers around the world, because it involved many of the transportation providers. Even providers that were not directly affected by the new regulation joined the group of transportation providers that were something unseen in capitalistic countries like the United States. Submarine Cable Cuts The year 2008 had an unusually high number of submarine cable cuts, cables carrying information between the Middle East, India, and the rest of the world. The disruption at one point in time, accord  ing to some experts, resulted in a 70 percent disruption of Internet connectivity in Egypt and as high as 60 percent for the Indian sub  continent. To varying degrees it also affected other countries like Bahrain, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Experts estimate that in total more than 80 million Internet users were affected by the outages. Up until today there has not been any evidence of malicious activities that would have resulted in the cable cuts, but it demonstrated how complex outsourcing mod  els are and how many factors play into a smooth operation. http: www.",

Some of the bigger outages that happened in 2009 2010 impacted T-Mobile, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, and other big names. The sources for the outages were sometimes simple things that in a traditional operational model could have had minimal impact but had a disastrous impact on the operations of the cloud, due to its monoculture characteristics, where problems easily repli  cate throughout the whole cloud infrastructure. From 2011 to 2013 cloud outages have become a common thing, impacting large web  sites. Unfortunately Cloud Service Providers seem to have adopted a practice of not providing any details about outages anymore. T-Mobile: Sidekick in Danger of the Microsoft Cloud On October 4, 2009 T-Mobile in the United States experienced a serious outage of their Sidekick service that relies on a cloud provided by Danger, a Microsoft subsidiary. Supposedly an update of Network Attached Storage (NAS) went quite wrong, resulting in a total data loss of some Sidekick users. After six days, without a plan to work it out and no backups in place, some users were left with a total data loss of their contact information. Outages at Amazon Are Sometimes due to  Gossip  Amazon had at least five outages between February 2008 and December 2009 that were documented in various news articles. The outages ranged from one hour to almost nine hours, leaving cus  tomers of the Simple Storage Service (S3) or the Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2) service without an option but to wait till Amazon had the situation back under control. In one case the company posted an explanation of what had happened.",

Why? During a contract revision the incident notification clause was dropped in the latest version of the contract. For that reason, the outsourcing com  pany did not have any obligation to notify the client about the loss of the laptop that potentially contained sensitive client information. Premature Transformation The client agreed to switch his network security monitoring company. During the transition the new network-monitoring company took on the monitoring of the various Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). After two months, the client got suspicious since no alerts had been received from the vendor. The client started running attacks on its own network, to see if the outsourcing company was picking up the attacks. The outsourcing Security Operation Center (SOC) picked up none of the attacks.

Malware has become a standard part of the arsenal an attacker deploys for malicious campaigns against targeted entities. The consequences of these attacks are not confined to the destruction of digital assets alone. With everything around us being controlled by digital assets that are connected with each other, a destruction or failure caused by malware can translate to destroyed infrastructure and even loss of human lives. Imagine a destruction of our power production, transmission, or distribution infrastructures, the result of which could be devastating. Malware threatens our national security. The theft of military secrets, defense and military strategy, and plans for new weapons can give adversaries an advantage. Compromised weapon control systems might have catastrophic consequences. Understanding a malware s main directive gives us the ability to mitigate its threat and strengthen our defenses against future generations of similar malware attacks. It helps us build better solutions that minimize the proliferation of malware and helps us detect and respond to compromises. Malware analysis is an indispensable skill for security professionals who are tasked with battling advanced threat actors head on. Malware analysis requires, aside from understanding the concepts of malware and the different tools available, a lot of patience and perseverance. It is often considered a challenging topic to tackle, but it is an exciting one. This book will walk you through the exciting paths of analyzing malware.",

What This Book Covers This book covers different malware concepts and the technologies these malicious software use to achieve their directive. The book then discusses how to hunt down and collect malware samples from different sources. Once malware samples xx Introduction are on hand, the book then shows how to set up your malware analysis lab, which ultimately leads to malware analysis by using the right set of tools the right way. How to Use This Book This book can be read from cover to cover. This will give you the most benefit because the book is written in such a way that the succeeding chapters build on top of the previous chapters. But this does not mean that this is the only way to read this book. Although the chapters are interrelated, they can be read separately without reading the previous or next one and still have the chapter s main idea and concept understood. Each chapter can stand on its own independently but also enjoys interdependency with the other chapters. Therefore, if you are already familiar with a specific chapter s subject matter, you can skip that chapter without sacrificing the book s continuity. And since the chapters are independent of each other, this book can be used as an excellent reference for malware analysis.",

Malware Analysis Malware analysis is the process of extracting information from malware through static and dynamic inspection by using different tools, techniques, and processes. It is a methodical approach to uncovering a malware s main directive by extracting as much data from malware as possible while it is at rest and in motion. LINGO A malware at rest is a malware that is not running in a target environment, while a malware in motion is a malware that is running in a target environment. Data is extracted from malware through the use of data extracting and monitoring tools. The techniques and processes needed to successfully gather data from malware differ depending on the malware s capability; they adapt to the changing malware landscape. This is why malware analysis is considered an art. The tools are your paintbrushes, the techniques and processes are your drawing style, and the malware is your subject. How effectively you use those tools and how well the techniques and processes are applied and refined will reflect how well the malware subject is pictured. It s a picture you create to show the malware s true identity stripped of all its protective mechanisms and revealing only its darkest and deepest malicious directive. The artist becomes better at her craft through practice and by gaining knowledge, skills, and experience as time goes by. The same concepts apply to the malware analyst and researcher.",

Chapter 1: Malware Analysis 101 5 Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering I always separate malware analysis from reverse engineering, although many consider reverse engineering as malware analysis. The way I see it, the two require two different sets of skills. Malware analysis is more about the mastery of different tools, techniques, and processes to extract as much information from malware without disassembling or decompiling it and to make malware function in a controlled environment for the purpose of monitoring and collecting data that can be used to understand the malware s true directive. LINGO Disassembling is the process of breaking down a binary into low-level code such as assembly code, while decompiling is the process of breaking down a binary into high-level code such as C or C. Malware reverse engineering, on the other hand, is the process of breaking down malware into low-level lines of code, usually assembly code, to fully understand its function. It requires that you can read and understand low-level code. This is where knowledge of assembly language becomes crucial. It is needed to decipher and read low-level code. Without this knowledge, it will be impossible to trace each line of code s execution flow let alone understand what each line of code actually means.",

Malware reverse engineering complements malware analysis. It is usually the last resort when malware analysis fails to extract the needed data from malware to paint an accurate picture. As we will discuss later in the  Limitations of Malware Analysis  section, reverse engineering is an important activity that serves as an addition to the malware analysis process. NOTE A combination of malware analysis and reverse engineering usually exposes new malware techniques that are otherwise not visible through malware analysis alone. Types of Malware Analysis As previously defined, malware analysis is the process of extracting information from malware through static and dynamic inspection by using different tools, techniques, and processes. Given that inspection or analysis can take place regardless of whether the malware is static or dynamic, it is only appropriate that the two types of malware analysis are called static analysis and dynamic analysis. 6 Part I: Malware Blueprint LINGO Static malware is malware at rest. Dynamic malware is malware in motion. Static Analysis Static analysis is the process of extracting information from malware while it is not running. Typically, malware is subjected to different static analysis tools, which will be detailed in succeeding chapters of the book that are designed to extract as much information as possible from the malware. The information that is collected can range from the simplest, such as the malware s file type, to the most complicated, such as identifying maliciousness based on non-encrypted code or strings found in the malware. Static analysis is the easiest and least risky malware analysis process. It is the easiest because there are no special conditions needed for analysis.",

    "content": "Static analysis is the easiest and least risky malware analysis process. It is the easiest because there are no special conditions needed for analysis. The malware is simply subjected to different static analysis tools. It is as easy as clicking some buttons or using a command line. It is less risky because the malware is not running during static analysis; therefore, there is no risk of an infection occurring while analysis is taking place. Another thing that makes static analysis less risky is the availability of tools in other operating system, such as Linux, that can be used to statically extract information from Windows files. Statically inspecting a malware in an operating system where the subject malware is not intended to execute eliminates the malware s ability to run and wreak havoc in the system. But not all static analysis tools that Windows offers have a counterpart or equivalent tool in other operating systems. This leaves the researcher no choice but to use those Windows-based tools. If this is the case and just an added precaution, Linux-based systems can still be used to run Windows-based static analysis tools by using WINE in Linux. WINE is short for Wine Is Not an Emulator.

With the influx of malware, malware analysis has become an indispensable tool for information technology professionals. This is because it has an important purpose, which is to understand malware for the purpose of stopping it. From this understanding of malware behavior, you can accomplish many things, such as formulating a solution to prevent the malware from spreading further or compromising new target systems, detecting the malware s presence on compromised systems, and remediating the infection caused by the malware by completely eradicating the malware s hold on the infected systems. Aside from formulating a solution for the specific malware, data collected can be used to gain a deeper understanding of malware in general. It gives researchers the knowledge to come up with proactive solutions to combat the onslaught of malware. And in some cases, these data can be used to formulate actionable intelligence that can be used by different law enforcement agencies to investigate and capture the people behind the attack.

A system scanner is any tool that scans the whole system for changes in the file system, registry, or operating system configuration files. For example, a researcher analyzed a malware that drops a copy of itself in the Windows Startup folder with the name IAMNOTAVIRUS. EXE. The researcher adds this data to a signature database that is used by a system scanner. If during a routine scan, the system scanner finds a file in the Windows Startup folder named IAMNOTAVIRUS. EXE, it will recognize this as a match in its signature database, and it will alert the user of an infection.

When it comes to detecting the presence of malware in the network, the most common indicator is its network communication. The data collected from network sniffers such as Wireshark is a good source for detecting the presence of malware while it is traversing the network or while it is communicating to the different network resources it needs. For example, during dynamic analysis, say a researcher was able to collect domains communicated to by the subject malware. These domains, upon further research and analysis, are determined to be network resources being used by malware, so they can be used to spot systems in the network that are possibly infected by malware. Any system that shows any sign of communication to and from these domains can be flagged as a possible compromised system. These are just a few examples of how data from malware analysis can be used to detect the presence of malware.

Dynamic analysis is all about making the malware successfully execute in a controlled environment. Therefore, its limitation is because of the different malware dependencies that enable it to run successfully in a target system. They are the following: Program dependencies     User dependencies     Environment dependencies     Timing dependencies     Event dependencies If one of these dependencies is not satisfied, the malware may not execute any or all of its functions. If the malware does not run because of an unsatisfied condition or dependency, no data will be collected during dynamic analysis. If the malware does run but some of its routines or functions are dependent on some of the factors mentioned, no data will be collected from those functions, which can result in an incomplete picture of the malware s behavior. This is the main reason why some malware analysis systems produce little data compared to other analysis systems. The malware analysis system that can satisfy more malware dependencies will produce more malware analysis data. For example, automated dynamic analysis systems, also known as automated malware sandboxes, can record only the malware behavior that the malware exhibits during the short amount of time it is running. Some functions that require special conditions, such as a user logged in to Facebook, an e-mail client running, network connection conditions such as home network versus corporate network, or even those that require hours to start executing their directive, will not be executed by the malware; thus, no visible behavior can be observed, Chapter 1: Malware Analysis 101 13 resulting to zero data gathered for those special functions.",

The data, which can be used to generate usable information, gathered from static analysis is collected and added to artifacts, code, and other information collected about the malware. The end goal here is to identify the malware s main directive and to create a solution for the malware to prevent it from spreading, detect its presence, and remediate, if possible, the malware infection. In most cases, static analysis is not enough, so the malware is subjected to dynamic analysis, where malware undergoes further scrutiny while it is running on a target system. The data gathered from dynamic analysis is added to the data collected from static analysis. If the data gathered from both static and dynamic analyses is enough to produce actionable intelligence to prevent the spread of malware, detect its presence, and possibly remediate compromise systems, then the analysis process usually ends. But if the malware proves to be difficult and static analysis and dynamic analysis yield poor results, reverse engineering is done to get to the bottom of what the malware really is.

As previously stated, the first step in the analysis process is to subject the malware to static analysis. If the collected information is enough to understand the malware and formulate a solution for it, then subjecting the malware to dynamic analysis becomes an optional or nice-to-have task. But this is rarely the case. Almost all the time, dynamic analysis is needed to collect more information to determine the malware s directive and formulate a solution based on dynamically gathered data from the malware sandbox. But if static and dynamic analyses prove to be not enough to understand the malware because of its complexity and sophistication, then reverse engineering becomes the last resort. Manual Malware Analysis During the early years of malware, when everything was still called viruses, malware analysis was mostly done by hand. A handful of tools, a single isolated system, and a lot of patience were all that was needed. During that time, this was the best way to analyze malware. Fast-forward to the present, and in my humble opinion, this is still the best way to analyze malware. Most of the techniques, methods, and concepts are still the same. The tools are better, and the test environment has expanded. The single system is now an isolated network of systems Chapter 1: Malware Analysis 101 15 and, if needed, has a restricted Internet connection.",

Performing manual malware analysis is always required, especially if the malware is noteworthy. This gives the analyst time and total control of the environment where malware is being executed for the purpose of analysis. LINGO Noteworthy malware is malware that exhibits new technology or is currently found in the wild. In the wild describes malware that is currently and actively infecting systems. The beauty of manual malware analysis is that the researcher has full control of the timing. The researcher can choose how long a malware must be executed and not be limited by time constraints used in automated malware analysis systems. In automated malware systems, the execution time for malware can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. This is not helpful, especially if the malware has a sleep function. A sleep function is a malware routine that allows it to be dormant for a period of time before it starts executing. It can be minutes, or it can be days. A malware with sleep function is the attacker s defense against automated malware analysis. Manual malware analysis also enables the researcher to be more interactive with malware.

This equates to about 1. 4 million unique malware samples per day, and that is already about 50 million more than all malware discovered in 2013. Note that this is discovered malware.

LINGO Automated malware analysis systems are also known as automated sandbox systems or simply sandbox. The term sandbox is widely used to describe automated systems because it is expected that a sandbox is always part of an automated malware analysis system. Static analysis complements dynamic analysis. I cannot stress this enough, but unfortunately some automated malware analysis systems do not utilize static analysis and proceed directly to dynamic analysis. In my humble opinion, this is a waste of sandbox resources. Static analysis is still needed not only to gather static information from malware but also to provide intelligence to the whole automated malware analysis system. One of the ways it does this is by determining whether the malware needs a special sandbox implementation. For example, if the analyst has different sandbox flavors and implementations, it is important to know which of those flavors and implementations will work well for the malware. This intelligence can be provided by static analysis. So instead of subjecting the malware blindly to the next available sandbox, the automated system, through the intelligence provided by the static analysis, can assign the malware to the appropriate sandbox, thus increasing the chances of a successful dynamic analysis session.",

Figure 1-3 shows an automated sandbox implementation taking advantage of static analysis. Before going into a detailed discussion of the automated sandbox implementation shown in Figure 1-3, it is important to note that not all files subjected to malware analysis, be it manual or automated, are malware. Most of the files are suspicious files that end up being proven to be a non-malware or benign file. This is the most important use case of malware analysis: to determine whether a file is malicious and, if it is malicious, gather as much data as possible to generate important information and actionable intelligence that will enable the analyst to prevent the spread of, detect the presence of, and remediate infection caused by malware. 18 Part I: Malware Blueprint In a typical scenario, a suspicious file is subjected to static analysis first. In this stage of the analysis process, all data that is collected from the file is processed. A typical static data analysis pre-processing determines the following: Has the file been processed before? Does it match any known benign files? Does it match any known malicious files? Does it require any special sandbox implementations? The first two are the most common reasons for a file to be dropped and not processed by the automated malware analysis system anymore. Answering the first two questions is made possible by identifying duplicate files and having a whitelist database as part of the automated malware analysis implementation.

For example, a malware that deletes all files on a hard disk and another that formats the hard drive can both be classified as a Trojan because of their destructive nature. If a file matches a family of malware, an automated sandbox can be configured to not process it anymore because indicators of compromise (IOC) were already collected from previous family members. LINGO Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are host and network footprints of malware that can be used to determine whether a system has been infected or compromised. An automated sandbox can also be configured to process the file to determine whether it is a new variant or whether it has new features that were not present in other family members that were processed before. If a file matches a malware class, the sample is seldom dropped. The malware class usually helps to determine what to monitor or look for during dynamic analysis. In some cases, it can be used to determine a specific sandbox implementation. For example, if a sample has been determined statically to have mass-mailing capabilities, it can be thrown into a sandbox that has different mail clients installed. The main idea here is throwing the suspicious file deemed to be malware into a sandbox implementation that satisfies all of its known dependencies to get the most promising results during dynamic analysis.

NOTE Static analysis can easily be beaten by packed and encrypted file. This is why file unpacking and decryption are important in the fight against malware. Static analysis also determines whether a file is packed and encrypted. If this is the case, appropriate actions are taken to statically unpack or decrypt a file so static analysis data can be gathered. If this is not possible, no static analysis can be done, and the file is subjected to the next available sandbox where the researcher can attempt to capture memory images of the unpacked file and then subject that captured memory image to static analysis. This is an example of dynamic analysis feeding samples to static analysis for the purpose of system improvement. In most cases, regardless of whether the file is packed, dynamic analysis yields promising results because the dynamic analysis system does not care whether a file is packed. The file will still function, and the dynamic analysis system can still capture data from the running file. But there will always be files or samples that will not yield any data through static and dynamic analyses.

An analyst must be familiar with how malware behaves, how malware operates to stay persistent, how malware protects itself, and how malware manipulates the target environment for it to execute its directives. In reality, malware analysis may not reveal all the information about the malware because of the known limitations of malware analysis and because of the sophistication and difficulty level of the malware. The analyst may get only bits and pieces of data that she needs to connect together and make sense of.

This is helpful especially, as stated previously, if the malware is extremely difficult to analyze and there is only a short amount of time available to understand what the malware is doing. Familiarization with malware enables the malware researcher and analyst to formulate information from bits and pieces of data and not come out empty handed. This comes with experience and education. The malware can then be tested again to either prove or disprove the conclusion drawn by the researcher or analyst from the bits of data gathered. TIP Reading malware blogs, white papers, and detailed malware technical reports helps in increasing familiarity with different malware characteristics. Part I of the book is all about malware. It is designed to serve as an introduction to novice researchers and analysts and a refresher to seasoned professionals. I will discuss the different classes of malware, how malware is deployed, how malware protects itself, and what the different dependencies are that malware has for it to function as designed by the attacker. Familiarization with Analysis Tools An effective malware analyst is someone who has the right skills and has the right tools. It has to be both. An analyst with skills but without the proper tools is like a carpenter trying to hammer a nail using a screwdriver. An analyst without skills but with the proper tools will not know what to do with them. Since you picked 22 Part I: Malware Blueprint up this book, I would say that you are already working on your skills. To sweeten the pot, I will throw in the analysis tools as well.",

This book will discuss the tools needed to analyze malware. I will start by showing how to set up a malware research lab and then go through the different static and dynamic analysis tools that will help you in becoming an effective malware analyst. Patience Malware analysis is not for those who get frustrated easily. As a malware analyst, you have to understand that analyzing malware will not always go the way you want it to go. There will be hiccups along the way. There will be unforeseen circumstances and challenges that might slow you down. Your limits and patience will be tested. But the key here is to recognize that this will happen, and you have to prepare yourself for it. There will be instances wherein nothing is going right and no data is being extracted from the malware. If this happens, you need to pause for a bit and give yourself some time to relax and then start tinkering again. Do not be afraid to try different things, different tool combinations, or different methods. Malware analysis is an art after all. TIP It is important to remember that malware analysis is not a set process, wherein you just follow a series of steps and arrive at your destination. Nothing is set in stone. Every malware analysis case can be different. The best thing to do is to recognize patterns of analysis so you can apply them as a mental template when faced with a malware analysis problem.

This page intentionally left blank 25 CHAPTER 2 Malware Taxonomy 26 Part I: Malware Blueprint T he first part of your journey into malware analysis is to understand the nature of malware, including why it exists and what its purpose, directive, and primary function are. Understanding all of these topics will help you get to the core of the malware s behavior, which is the main goal of analyzing malware. The first step in accomplishing this is to understand the different classes of malware. This is where malware taxonomy comes into the picture. Malware taxonomy is the process of classifying malware into different groups using a systematic approach based on its characteristics or attributes. It results in wellorganized groups of malware with recognizable relationship patterns. Becoming familiar with these patterns enables you to identify specific malware that belongs to a certain class. It also leads to the discovery of a new and unknown class of malware, especially if the characteristics or attributes of the newly discovered malware do not fit any of the known classes. Familiarization with different classes of malware helps you predict malware behavior based on patterns of characteristics or attributes that are revealed during the stages of analysis. If this gathered data is similar to a certain class of malware, it will be easy for you to conclude what the malware s main directive is. In this instance, you save time and effort by not going through the other steps of analysis because what you need to know was already revealed by the patterns you found.",

Classifications include target operating system (OS), such as Windows, OS X, or Unix; target device, such as mobile devices or desktop devices; vector dependencies; spreading mechanisms; type of victims; and more. Each of these taxonomy methods serves a purpose. It may be a specific purpose or something that covers a wide range of needs. An analyst who wants to eliminate or mitigate a malware s infection vector might be interested in classifying malware based on vector dependencies and spreading mechanisms, while someone who wants to build a computing infrastructure might be more interested in classifying malware based on target OS, target device, and type of victims the malware is after. In most cases, an understanding of all these classes is needed to secure an organization. Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 27 In this book, I will classify malware based on its behavior.",

The categories are as follows: Infectors     Network worms     Trojan horses     Backdoors     Remote-access Trojans     Information stealers     Ransomware     Scareware     Fakeware     Greyware It is important to note that malware does not neatly fall into just one category. The attackers do not write malware to stick to one class alone or follow strictly the description of a specific class. This is not their concern. Their main concern is for malware to execute based on their directive. If achieving the attacker s directive means creating a malware that infects files to spread, which is classified as an infector, and with backdoor capability, then so be it. In reality, therefore, most malware will exhibit two or more of the behaviors in the previous list. This reality can pose a challenge in classifying malware. To solve this, researchers and the industry at large moved to classify malware based on class priority. The classes listed previously are based on priority, with infectors being the highest priority and greyware being the lowest. This is the common practice in the industry. To better illustrate this, let s take two imaginary malware as an example: first a malware that spreads via e-mail that also has the ability to infect files, and second a malware that is destructive that also has a backdoor capability that provides access to a compromised system. Based on class prioritization, the first example of the e-mail malware is classified as an infector, while the second example is classified as a Trojan. TIP Malware classes can be considered as attributes or characteristics and tagged as such. If one malware exhibits two or more class behaviors, it can be tagged with those classes.",

Based on the e-mail malware example, the malware can be classified, or tagged, as an infector and a network worm. This makes it easy to query for malware based on class behavior. In this scenario, the prioritization is not an issue. Instead, the main issue is to tag the malware with all the class behaviors it is exhibiting. This is useful when it comes to profiling malware. Infectors A malware that spreads by attaching a copy of its malicious code to a target host is known as an infector. Its main directive is to populate by infecting other computer files that are usually of the same file type. The first infectors were called computer viruses. Named after their real-world counterparts that spread from one human host to another causing an epidemic within a small community, these computer viruses instead infect files causing a system-wide infection within the compromised system. In the old days, computer viruses were considered to have reached pandemic proportions if computer systems from different geographical locations became infected because of removable media usage such as floppy disks.",

Before the term malware was coined, all malicious programs were collectively called computer viruses. Computer viruses are self-replicating programs that spread from one host to another. They were mainly file and boot sector infectors. But because of advances in technology and the ability to spread to other systems through other means that are much more efficient and faster than file and boot sector infection, infectors have vanished into the annals of malware history. Infectors are rare nowadays, but it is still important to know about them, especially if you are going to deal with malware that has been armored by tools such as binders and joiners, which I will discuss in detail in succeeding chapters. LINGO Binders and joiners are malware tools that enable a malware to attach itself to a benign file. Infectors are divided into the following types: File infectors     Boot sector viruses     Multipartite viruses Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 29 File Infectors File infectors defined the computer virus era. All widespread computer viruses during the DOS era were file infectors. File infectors attach themselves to host programs, and then these infected files serve as the virus carrier to other systems. When an infected file is executed, the virus code in the infected file gets executed first, and after that is done, the execution flow is then passed to the code of the host program.

LINGO The changing of execution flow from virus code to the host code is also referred to as passing control. Before a host becomes an infected file or a virus carrier, file infection has to take place. File infection can occur in two ways. Through direct infection     Through memory infection Direct infection occurs when a virus actively looks for files in the system to infect. Depending on the search parameters of the virus, it might search for files in selected folders such as the operating system folder, the programs folder, or the current folder where the virus was executed; or it can search for files in the whole system. Memory infection, on the other hand, occurs when a host file is executed and is loaded in memory. In this form of infection, the virus does not actively look for files to infect; rather, it sits in memory waiting for a host file to be executed. Once a host file is executed, the virus attaches itself to the host file s code in memory, and when the operation is complete, the virus code is saved to the file on disk. NOTE Direct infection occurs when the host files are static, while memory infection occurs when the host file is running. As a result, direct infection has the potential of infecting all malware-supported file types in the system, even those files that have not been executed for a long time. 30 Part I: Malware Blueprint There are different types of file infectors.",

Executables     Macros     Scripts Executables In the early years of malware, almost all infectors were executables. They were either a COM file or an EXE file. Some of them infect exclusively their own file type; i. e. , COM infects COM only, and EXE infects EXE only. But there are those that infect all file types regardless of what the original malware s file type is; i. e. , COM infects both COM and EXE, and EXE infects both COM and EXE. Regardless of what file type the computer virus is, it follows certain patterns when it comes to infecting or attaching its code to the host file. These patterns of infection serve as a way to classify viruses and file infectors. They are the following: Overwriting viruses     Companion viruses     Parasitic viruses An overwriting virus is the most destructive of all file infectors because, as the name suggests, the virus overwrites the host code with its own. This results in the total destruction of the host file. There is no way to recover from this infection unless there is a backup of the overwritten host file. Figure 2-1 shows the results of an overwriting virus infection. Figure 2-1 shows two different scenarios. If the size of the host file is bigger than the overwriting virus, the resulting file is the overwriting virus plus the remaining bytes at the end of the host file. The virus simply overlays itself on the host file. If the size of the host file is equal to or smaller than the overwriting virus, the resulting file is the overwriting virus itself, an exact copy, because it has completely overwritten the host file.",

If the size of the host file is equal to or smaller than the overwriting virus, the resulting file is the overwriting virus itself, an exact copy, because it has completely overwritten the host file. In some cases where performance is a must, such as it was during the DOS era, the overwriting virus, regardless of the size of the host file, simply replaces the host file with its own copy and changes its name to that of the host file. Although this improves the malware s performance, it also has a drawback. Replacing the host file with a copy of the virus can lead to easy detection via optical inspection by simply listing the files in the directory. For example, say an overwriting virus Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 31 with a file size of 470 bytes infects a folder of several thousands of files that originally have different file sizes. Listing the files in this folder will show all of them having 470 bytes each, which will arouse suspicion. In addition, assuming the malware does not have a routine to retain the original date of the infected host files, the infected files will have similar timestamps, which will definitely scream infection. These telltale signs are so obvious that optical inspection makes it easy to spot the virus. Another telltale sign of an overwriting virus infection is that every time an infected host file is executed, it will not function as expected because the virus code completely destroyed the original program or host code so there is nothing to pass the control to after the virus code has executed, which is often silent.

Companion viruses are interesting because they are the only ones that do not really attach their malware code to the host file. I often refer to them as an exception to the rule. But even without attaching companion virus code to the host file, the virus code is still executed first, and control is still passed to the host program code for it to execute its function and not raise suspicion. The virus is able to do this, without the need to attach its code, by using the operating system s rules and capabilities, which are the following: File type execution hierarchy     Ability to set a file s attribute to HIDDEN File type execution hierarchy, on the other hand, deals with deciding which files with the same name but different executable extension get to be executed first. In DOS and Windows, this hierarchy exists. The order of execution based on filename is COM, then EXE, and then BAT.",

    "content": "In DOS and Windows, this hierarchy exists. The order of execution based on filename is COM, then EXE, and then BAT. For example, if there are three files with the names HELLO. BAT, HELLO. EXE, and HELLO. COM in the same folder, typing HELLO only without any extension at the command line will execute HELLO. COM. Deleting HELLO. COM and typing HELLO at the command line again executes HELLO. EXE. Deleting HELLO. EXE leaves the user with HELLO. BAT, so typing HELLO executes HELLO. BAT. Evidently, taking advantage of file type execution hierarchy works best in command lines, which is why companion viruses were highly successful during the DOS era but not in modern operating systems. TIP Make it a habit to type the entire filename when executing a file at the command line. Figure 2-2 (a) shows an example of a companion virus renaming a target host file s extension and setting its attribute to HIDDEN. For example, when VIRUS. COM infects HOST. COM, the virus renames HOST. COM to HOST. CON (note the N) and sets its attribute to HIDDEN. Then the virus renames itself to HOST. COM. So when the user executes HOST. COM, he is actually executing the virus, and then after the virus executes, it passes control to HOST. CON, which is the real HOST. COM. This scenario is applicable to COM files because COM is highest when it comes to file execution hierarchy. Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 33 Figure 2-2 (b) shows how VIRUS. COM or VIRUS. EXE deals with an EXE file. Instead of renaming and setting the attribute of the target host file (HOST. EXE), the virus renames itself and sets its attribute to HIDDEN.

Figure 2-2 Companion virus infection. 34 Part I: Malware Blueprint There are two types of parasitic viruses, as shown in Figure 2-3. Prepending     Appending A prepending parasitic virus attaches itself to the top of the host file. In this type of infection, there is little need for file instruction manipulation because the virus code is on top of the file, so the virus code gets executed first. As for an appending virus, the virus code attaches itself at the end of the file. If parasitic virus is the classic form of file infection, an appending parasitic virus is the classic form of parasitic virus infection. It hijacks the host file s first instruction to point to the virus code. After virus execution, it passes control back to the host program code. As mentioned, the virus is able to do this by saving the location of the host file s first instruction. Macros What is a macro?

Scripts Since a macro is a scripting language, it is not far-fetched to use other scripts as platforms for viruses. The only difference between a macro virus and a script virus is that the script does not need to be embedded in a file. It can be embedded, or it can be a stand-alone script. The most utilized scripting languages to write script viruses are Visual Basic Script (VBS) and JavaScript. VBS is supported by Windows, so there are no special dependencies needed for it to run properly. As for JavaScript, it usually works as part of an application such as a web browser and a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.

Boot Sector Viruses A virus always wants to get control of the system s execution flow first, even before the operating system. One way to achieve that is to infect the boot sector of the disk. The boot sector is located at sector 1 of each volume. As defined by Microsoft, 1 the boot sector is a critical disk structure for starting a computer. It contains executable code and data required by the code, including information that the file system uses to access the volume. The boot sector is created when a volume is formatted. At the end of the boot sector is a 2-byte structure called a signature word or end-of-sector marker, which is always set to 0x55AA. For example, a Windows 2000 boot sector consists of the following elements: An x86-based central processing unit (CPU) jump instruction     The original equipment manufacturer identification (OEM ID)     The BIOS parameter block (BPB) data structure     The extended BPB     The executable boot code, also known as the bootstrap code, that starts the operating system Similar to a file infector, a boot sector virus works by taking control of the boot sector s first instruction. It does this by hijacking the x86-based CPU jump instruction and pointing it to the malicious boot sector virus code. Once the virus code executes, it passes control back to the original boot sector code. The location of this can be found in the hijacked x86-based CPU jump instruction.",

LINGO Nowadays, multipartite refers to viruses that are capable of multiplatform infection, not just boot and file infections. Network Worms A network worm is a type of malware that replicates or spreads via a network with little or no user intervention using widely used network services such as Internet browsers, e-mail, and chat, among others. Worms usually rely on social engineering to spread, while the most advanced worms exploit software vulnerabilities to infect other systems. The reach of the network worm when it comes to potential victims is massive. Everyone who is online or connected to any network such as the Internet is a potential victim. Network worms changed the game when it came to the speed and coverage of infection. Before the advent of network worms, malware infections were limited to file infections, which spread slowly. And if they did spread, the coverage was usually just a small geographical area. But network worms spread widely and quickly across networks with no geographical boundaries, giving meaning to the 38 Part I: Malware Blueprint term malware outbreak. What took days or even months for a typical malware to spread across different geographic location takes only seconds for a network worm to accomplish.

Mass mailers     File-sharing worms     Instant messaging (IM) worms     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) worms     Local network worms     Internet worms Mass Mailers Worms that spread via e-mail are called mass mailers. Social engineering is usually this worm s most potent weapon. It fools the user into downloading and executing an e-mail attachment, which is the worm itself. Or if the e-mail is not carrying any file to avoid anti-spam solutions, it persuades the user into clicking a link, which oftentimes leads to a download site that installs a malware onto the user s machine. File-Sharing Worms A file-sharing worm spreads through publicly facing file-sharing folders by dropping a copy of itself into a folder using an enticing filename that users will likely download to their systems and execute. File-sharing worms usually take advantage of file-sharing peer-to-peer programs to spread. A few example of enticing file names are below. MSOfficeCrack. EXE     FreeAntivirus. EXE     PopularGameUnlockedVersion. EXE Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 39 IM Worms Instant messaging worms spread through IM. The worm utilizes the infected system s installed IM software by sending messages to the user s contact list. The message usually contains a malicious link pointing to a drive-by download site. In some cases, instead of sending a malicious link, the IM worm initiates file transfers to the target victims in the contact list. Since the file transfer is coming from a known contact and the file has an enticing name, there is a big chance the target victim will accept the file transfer, download it, and then execute it. IM worms are good at exploiting trust because the target user thinks the link or file is coming from a friend.",

LINGO The server component is the one that is deployed by the attackers to compromise a system, while the client component is the one that the attackers use to control the server component in the compromised system. IRC Worms IRC worms spread through IRC channels by sending messages containing malicious links or instructions that the receiver or target victim should type in return for something such as  free software  or  ops channel privilege. The links point to a website that serves the worm, while the instruction that the target victim is being socially engineered to type results in a series of commands that can infect not just the target victim s system but also the other users in the channel. IRC worms also utilize direct client-to-client (DCC) file transfer requests. The worm usually sends the requests to users joining the channel. These files, like any other socially engineered malicious files, have enticing names to increase their chances of being executed in the target system. Local Network Worms Local network worms spread within the confines of a local area network (LAN). A local network worm spreads by scanning for write-enabled share folders in servers or hosts connected to the network. Once it finds these types of share folders, it drops a copy of itself there using enticing names, as usual. The worm also searches for public folders in the network and drops a copy of itself there.",

Another way this type of worm spreads, without using shared folders, is by exploiting vulnerabilities found in an OS or other software used in a corporate 40 Part I: Malware Blueprint environment. Successful exploitation often leads to machine compromise. Instead of scanning for folders, the worm scans for software used in host machines connected to the local area network. Internet Worms Internet worms spread to other system by scanning the Internet for vulnerable machines. Oftentimes, Internet worms use vulnerable browsers to infiltrate target systems. An unpatched system that is connected to the Internet always runs the risk of being infected by an Internet worm. NOTE An unpatched system is a good way to collect malware samples just by connecting to the Internet. Trojan Horse A Trojan horse, also known simply as a Trojan, is a destructive malware in disguise. It passes itself as a harmless, legitimate program that is enticing to the user. It can disguise itself as a game, a tool, or even popular software. The main idea is to convince the user to run it. The main directive of a Trojan is destruction of files or the system. The end result is usually loss of files and an inoperable system. The only way to recover from a Trojan is by restoring from backup or reinstalling the whole system. Backdoors Backdoors enable an attacker to gain access to a compromised system, bypassing any form of digital safeguards and authentication, usually through the use of vulnerable and undocumented OS and network functions. The access can be an open shell with root permission. An important characteristic or attribute of a backdoor is stealth because its success lies in it being hidden and undetected.",

Once it is discovered, it is  game over  for the attacker. Remote-Access Trojan A remote-access Trojan (RAT), also known as remote administration Trojan, is a malicious system administration tool that has backdoor capabilities, enabling an attacker to gain root access to the compromised machine through a stealthy malicious program running in the system. Unlike a backdoor that typically uses Chapter 2: Malware Taxonomy 41 a shell, a RAT uses a client-server model. A RAT has a user interface (UI), also known as the client component, that the attacker can use to issue commands to the server component residing in the compromised machine. Looking at the RAT s user interface, you can immediately determine what the attacker can do to the compromised machine. The UI is so revealing that it is easy to analyze the malware. But the challenge here is obtaining a copy of the client component, which is usually in the attacker s possession. Most of the time, researchers and analysts are left only with the server part, which is extracted from the compromised machine.

The captured keystrokes can be stored locally for future retrieval, which was true for early keyloggers, or sent to a remote server to which the attacker has access. Desktop Recorders Desktop recorders work by taking a screenshot of the desktop or the active window when the conditions are met for the malware to capture such information. Usually, the conditions are event driven, such as a mouse click or keyboard press, or is determined by a certain time interval. Desktop recorders are oftentimes used to get around virtual keyboards utilized by some online banks. One disadvantage of desktop recorders is the amount of data they store. The file size of each screenshot quickly adds up. Memory Scrapers Data and code when in memory are decrypted, which is the only way they can be processed. Memory scrapers take advantage of this fact by stealing information in memory while it is being processed. Memory is always the best place to grab data because everything is decrypted.

The data can be specific such as documents, pictures, or files with specific extensions, or it can be a lockdown of the whole disk or a certain partition. The main idea here is that the data is held hostage, preventing the user from accessing it.

Or a more devious act can be purported by the attacker, such as running away with the money and leaving the victimized user with inaccessible data and a big hole in his pocket. The most telling characteristic of this type of ransomware is that it has encryption algorithms. Data Destruction This is like saying, Pay up or I will blow up the town. In this scenario, the user is given a time frame to pay or the data or hard drive will be wiped clean. This typically happens after data is encrypted to prevent the user from copying or backing up anything, and then the attackers resort to this type of extortion so they get the money immediately.

This is why they are classified as grayarea software or greyware. The most common greyware types are the following: Joke     Hacktools     Adware     Spyware LINGO Greyware is also known as a potentially unwanted program (PUP). Joke A joke greyware is a program designed to fool the user into believing that something is wrong with the system when really there is nothing wrong.

These programs are harmless and do nothing malicious to the system, but they are nuisances. Joke programs are supposed to be fun, but they have the potential of producing unwanted consequences depending on the victim s reaction. Take, for example, the blue screen of death (BSOD) joke program. This program makes the user believe that the system is not functioning anymore. If the user is not aware that this is a joke, he might resort to formatting the system immediately to fix the  problem. 46 Part I: Malware Blueprint If the user has backed up of all his files, this is fine.

Some organizations want hacktools and administration tools absent from all systems connected to their network except for those used by network and system administrators. Think of these like guns. Guns in the hands of law enforcement are used for preserving the peace and for upholding the law, but guns in the wrong hands can have deadly consequences. Adware Adware is short for advertisement software or ad-supported software. These are programs that display advertisement pop-ups. These pop-ups are definitely a nuisance because they appear more frequently than they are supposed to, and most of the time, the pop-ups are offensive to some users. Adware became popular in free software. A developer posts or shares a product for free, but to recover development costs and to generate income, the freeware is most of the time bundled with adware. This gave rise to the term ad-supported software. The user can continue using the software as long as the ads are displayed. NOTE There is nothing bad about ad-supported software.",

Recap Malware taxonomy is the process of classifying malware. Depending on the need, malware can be classified in different ways. But for our purposes, you can classify malware based on its behavior or directive. The following are the different classes of malware that were discussed in this chapter: Infectors     Network worms     Trojan horses     Backdoors     Remote-access Trojans     Information stealers     Ransomware     Scareware     Fakeware     Greyware 48 Part I: Malware Blueprint Classifying malware enables analysts to come up with well-organized groups of malware with recognizable patterns. Familiarity with these patterns is important to make an educated guess about a malware s main functionality, especially if the data gathered during analysis is not enough to paint a complete picture of the malware. It also makes analysis efficient by enabling analysts to predict malware behavior based on the patterns that are revealed during the different stages of analysis, thus saving time and effort by not having to go through the other steps of analysis. 49 CHAPTER 3 Malware Deployment 50 Part I: Malware Blueprint B efore malware can do any real damage, it must reach the target system. To reach a target system, the attackers use or abuse different technologies, some of which are legitimate while others are designed purely to deploy malware. Malware deployment is just as important as the actual capabilities of malware.",

    "content": "Malware deployment is just as important as the actual capabilities of malware. Without the deployment technology, malware, no matter how sophisticated, will be rendered useless. Think of malware as soldiers. For them to reach their target site, they must be deployed effectively and oftentimes under stealth. This is why capable countries invest in air, land, and sea deployment vehicles for the purpose of successfully carrying soldiers to their target destinations. This is the same concept when it comes to malware deployment technologies. The attackers invest heavily in the most effective and stealthy deployment technology to deliver their malware. One example of this is the exorbitant price of a newly discovered, zeroday vulnerability. Malware deployment does not concern itself with the execution of malware, although some deployment technology has that capability. It is mostly concerned about malware reaching its intended target. For instance, in the early days of computer viruses, the often-used technology to deploy or spread malware was the floppy disk. The disk carried infected host files, and an infected disk, once placed inside a disk drive, was considered a successful deployment. The malware had reached its target. Infection of the target system was possible because the infected files reached the target, and if a user executed these infected files, the result was a compromised system. As previously stated, some deployment technology has the capability of automatically executing malware, resulting in deployment and infection. Going back to the disk example, if a disk is infected with a boot sector virus, simply accessing the disk will execute the boot sector virus, causing system compromise. There is no need for a user to execute any infected files to infect the target system.",

The ability to execute the malware once it reaches a target is an added bonus, especially if a deployment technology has this capability. The physical media, and other techniques or technology used to deploy malware are called malware infection vectors. In this chapter, I will discuss what a malware infection vector is and how it is used by attackers to deploy malware to their targets.

I will then conclude the chapter by identifying the different characteristics that make a technology suitable for becoming a malware infection vector.

If one fails, so does the attack campaign. There are a lot of infection vectors at the disposal of attackers. I will enumerate these different infection vectors later in the chapter. To help attackers choose which one is best for their specific needs, they consider the different dimensions of each malware infection vector. Infection vectors are chosen based on the different dimensions they offer. The following are the important dimensions of an infection vector: Speed     Stealth     Coverage     Shelf life Speed The speed by which infection occurs is important to the attackers. Depending on the attacker s intent, she might choose the slow physical media infection vector that relies on physical transport by humans or the faster e-mail infection vector 52 Part I: Malware Blueprint that relies on the speed of different network connections to reach a target. If time is of the essence, the faster infection vector is always chosen. If there is no rush and the target system to be compromised is not connected to any network systems, the physical media might be the better alternative. The speed by which a malware can reach a target is quite scary. Before everybody was connected to the Internet and everyone had e-mail, malware infection was slow. Almost all malware relied on physical media, and malware infection was not a big thing.

There were infections that are well known during those times but not as impactful as the infections that occur when everybody got on the World Wide Web. With the advent of e-mail and so many computers and devices connected to the Internet, malware now has a faster infection vector in e-mail. This means malware has the ability to reach targets in an instant.

The speed and coverage of an e-mail infection vector make it possible to have a worldwide malware outbreak. Stealth A successful infection vector is one that cannot be detected easily and can bypass most security solutions. The stealthiest infection vector by far is vulnerable software. A well-crafted exploit can easily bypass most security hurdles and take advantage of the vulnerable software s permissions and privileges. It is always a challenge to detect a zero-day vulnerability.

No matter how state-of-the-art or best-of-breed security solutions are used to guard the network from infiltration and infection, the lowly physical media can easily infect an endpoint, which can serve as the staging ground for further infections within the network. Coverage Coverage means the number of targets an infection vector can reach. Is it a single target? Is it in the tens of thousands? Is it in the millions across geopolitical borders? All of these are possible depending on the infection vector chosen. In an opportunistic attack, the desired coverage is as many as possible. Therefore, an e-mail spam carrying the malware or linking to the malware is often used as the infection vector.",

A decoupled deployment technology is an infection vector that is not initiated by the malware but controlled by the actors behind an attack. Chapter 3: Malware Deployment 55 LINGO A decoupled infection vector is a deployment technology separate from the malware itself. Decoupled infection vectors can be used to deploy different kinds of malware and are not dependent on any malware that they deploy. For example, an e-mail carrying a malware in the initial stages of infection is considered a decoupled infection vector if the malware does not initiate the sending of that e-mail. Since the malware does not initiate the e-mail, the e-mail won t be part of the analysis because it s not possible to know it was involved. This is similar to how a person carrying an infected disk to a computer won t be seen by analysts after the fact. But if the malware when active sends out more e-mail carrying itself, then that e-mail infection vector is not decoupled because you can see that behavior once the malware is analyzed. NOTE Sometimes it is a challenge to determine how a system got infected from the malware alone, especially if the malware was deployed using a decoupled infection vector.

    "content": "Since computer viruses are mostly file infectors, the only way they can reach another system is to be manually carried to that system through the use of a disk. A malware with no capabilities of spreading through any other means than file infection usually uses this infection vector. It is already assumed that the infection vector is physical media since there is no other way for this type of malware to get into another system. But if a malware infects physical media such as the boot sector or sets itself up in the physical media to take advantage of the autorun capabilities of the target OS, then that is clear evidence the malware uses physical media as its infection vector. But what if the malware does not exhibit these capabilities? Is it still possible to use physical media as an infection vector? The answer is yes. There have been cases where malware that has no routine to infect files or boot sectors is deployed using physical media. For example, someone giving away USB sticks outside of an office building, a school, or anywhere for that matter, can simply put a sophisticated malware on the USB stick hoping that somebody will put it in a system and start the infection process. In this case, the USB stick is a decoupled infection vector because the malware did not put itself on the USB stick; therefore, no traces of this activity will be found during analysis. 56 Part I: Malware Blueprint TIP Be wary of free USB sticks even at security conferences; they might be carrying more than what they re supposed to be carrying. E-mails One of the fastest ways to reach someone is through e-mail. The same thing goes for malware. Anyone with an e-mail address is a potential target.",

Lots of noteworthy malware went on to produce worldwide outbreaks because of e-mail; among them are the ILOVEYOU worm, as shown in Figure 3-1, and the Melissa worm. If during analysis it becomes evident that a malware accesses the default mail client, accesses the user s address book, or uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), chances are that malware uses e-mail as its main infection vector to spread to other systems. Even with lots of e-mail security solutions available, the use of e-mail as an infection vector is still popular with attackers because most solutions can be easily bypassed and the e-mail vector is cheap and fast. Plus, there are still lots of users who are easily fooled by simple social engineering tactics. Figure 3-2 shows an example of a socially engineered e-mail vector created for an opportunistic attack. Figure 3-1 ILOVEYOU worm. Chapter 3: Malware Deployment 57 LINGO There are two types of attacks: targeted and opportunistic. A targeted attack is geared toward a specific company, individual, or entity and usually takes ample preparation from the attackers before it is executed. An opportunistic attack, on the other hand, is a form of attack that is waged to as many potential victims as possible. It does not have a specific target. The main goal is to have as many system infections as possible. Instant Messaging and Chat Instant is the magic word when it comes to IM and chat. It s real time. Although e-mail is fast, slow e-mail servers can delay the delivery of a malware or drop the infected message altogether because of non-compliance with e-mail policies or being blocked by mail security products.

But when used as infection vectors, IM and chat usually deliver malicious links pointing to a malware-serving domain or a drive-by download site.

It depends on what malware is being served by the malicious link. LINGO A malware-serving domain is a domain that links to a network resource that hosts malware. A drive-by download site installs malware once a victim visits that site. Instant messaging and chat take advantage of trust. A compromised system can make use of the victim s IM account to send malicious links or files to that victim s entire list of friends.

Social Networking Social networks are popular. They not only are used to connect with someone but also are used to promote products. The more registered users a social network has, the more valuable it is, and the number of users is directly proportional to its popularity. Some social networks are so popular that the number of registered users actually exceeds the population of some countries, as shown in Figure 3-3. Social networks offer features that are desirable to attackers. Among them is the ability to send instant messages and post updates in the form of feeds. The feeds can be visible to friends only or to the public. The feeds are desirable to the attackers because the links remain posted until they are taken down; they are just there waiting for unsuspecting users to click them. Social networks also take advantage of trust. Attackers can post malicious links to the compromised account s wall, and posts can be made to a friend s feed wall. That friend will think it s legitimate, and chances are he will click that link.

File Shares Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing is commonly taken advantage of by malware to get into the system of other users. A malware will drop a copy of itself in the public-facing file share folders. This makes the malware available to all peers that are downloading files.

All software has bugs, and some have flaws. Some are known, while others are not. Some are critical, while others are minor. Depending on the severity of the bug, it can have unpredictable and unintended results. The attackers, with some of them being software developers themselves, recognize the value of an unknown or undiscovered critical bug waiting to be exploited in certain software. It is important to know the difference between a software bug and a software flaw. A software bug is an issue with a feature that is not functioning as intended, while a software flaw is an error in the design and architecture of the software. A bug can be fixed by a patch, but a flaw can be fixed only by a complete redesign of the software. The advantage of using software vulnerabilities as an infection vector over other infection vectors is that it significantly lowers, if not totally eliminates, the need for human interaction. Typically, it results in the automated execution of malware, which is what is considered the most effective way of infecting a system. It also takes advantage of software that is whitelisted in the system, thus evading any sort of application control security products.",

The concept of this security product or feature is to let only known whitelisted applications to run in a system. 62 Part I: Malware Blueprint Lots of material covers software vulnerabilities already. With this in mind, I will focus on those that are used to install malware on a system. To take advantage of software vulnerabilities, the attackers use an exploit. An exploit can be a piece of code or a chunk of malformed data that causes the target software to behave in a way not intended by the software manufacturer. The most common exploit is the one that takes advantage of buffer overflow. NOTE An exploit is not a vulnerability. An exploit is something that takes advantage of a vulnerability. Buffer Overflow Software consists of two distinct components: code and data. Code is the set of instructions that makes use of data. During data manipulation, software often makes use of a temporary data storage called a buffer. A buffer is created to hold data and nothing more. But sometimes, because of programmatic error, more data is written to the allocated buffer. This results in data overflowing to adjacent buffers. This condition is called a buffer overflow. Attackers take advantage of this by overflowing the buffer with code instead of data. The buffer is overflowed in such a way to transfer the control to that code, thus executing it.",

The often-used buffer overflows are     Stack overflow     Heap overflow It is important to note that a buffer overflow can be triggered using a malformed file. The malformed file is the one that is deployed by the attacker. Once this file is opened using the vulnerable application, the data from the malformed file overflows the buffer. Getting hold of a malformed file during malware hunting helps in understanding how the vulnerable application is being exploited. Stack Overflow The stack is a last-in first-out (LIFO) data structure. This means the data that is pushed last onto the stack is what is popped out first. It is aptly called a stack because it is stacking data on top of one another. Think of it like a stack of plates. The last plate that is put on the top of the stack is the one that is used first. Because of its LIFO nature, the stack is often used to store temporary variables, making it efficient to use with program functions. Stack overflow is the result of overflowing the buffers on the stack to get control of the execution flow of the program. This is made possible by overflowing the Chapter 3: Malware Deployment 63 buffer enough to overwrite the value stored in the return address (RET).

It s independent, compartmentalized code that performs specific operations using data passed to it and then returns the result to the main program. Since a function has to manipulate data, it utilizes the stack as a temporary storage for this data. When a function is called within a program, it pushes all the data into the stack, including the return address. To understand what the stack looks like, see Figure 3-5. The return address is where the instruction pointer is currently pointing when the function is called. This is important because after the function has finished processing, the execution flow has to go back to that return address so the main program can continue its execution flow. This value is stored in RET. When the function finishes, the value stored in RET is passed to the instruction pointer so the main program can go back to its execution flow before the function was called. So if the attacker is able to overflow the buffer and as a result overwrite the value stored in RET with an address value that points to malicious code, the instruction pointer will point directly to the malicious code, resulting in the malicious code being executed. Heap Overflow The heap is dynamically allocated memory space. The logic behind this is that the amount of memory needed by a program is not known in advance; therefore, memory has to be allocated as needed and freed up when Figure 3-5 What the stack looks like during a function call.

The difference between a heap and a stack is that a heap does not have a return address like a stack does. This makes the technique used to control execution flow in stack overflow useless. Overflowing a heap instead results in data and pointers to other data or program functions being overwritten. As a result, the attacker can overwrite these pointers to point to malicious code instead of the original location. Privilege Escalation The ability of a software vulnerability to deliver and install malware in a system depends on its getting privilege escalation. Privilege escalation is the process of gaining access to system resources that are accessible only to a superuser or system administrator. With this, the attacker can do pretty much anything with the system, including installing malware. Privilege escalation is achieved when the exploited, vulnerable software (or some of its components) is already running on escalated privilege or it has access to system resources or functions running on escalated privileges. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities The knowledge of a program s vulnerabilities that can be exploited is often kept private by the attacker. This is known as a zero-day vulnerability. A zero-day vulnerability is an exploitable hole in an operating system, software, or even hardware that has no solution and has been discovered by those other than the manufacturers or publishers of the vulnerable object. If an independent researcher has discovered a zero-day vulnerability, the next step is to report this to the manufacturer or publisher so a patch or a new minor version can be released that fixes the vulnerability.",

Some software manufacturers even pay for this kind of information, making vulnerability discovery a good independent business for software hobbyists. But it s a different story if an attacker discovers it. It is usually kept secret to be used in future attacks or to be sold to other cybercrime groups. Keeping it a secret creates immense value because this vector s shelf life depends on how long it is kept a secret and how long before a patch is released to fix it. There have been cases where a vulnerability has been public already but the patch to fix it was pending release; thus, any malware that utilized this vulnerability still enjoyed some level of success. Unfortunately, the only way to prevent vulnerable software with no available patch or fix from being exploited is to uninstall or not use it, but in cases where the software is vital to an enterprise s operation, this is usually out of the question.

As stated previously, it is as important as the actual capabilities of malware. Without the deployment technology, malware, no matter how sophisticated it is, would be rendered useless. Having familiarity with the different malware infection vectors enables analysts to determine how the malware spreads. This answers the important question of how the victim got infected and also helps security professionals in securing networks. In this chapter, I discussed what an infection vector is and how attackers use it to deploy their malware. I enumerated the four dimensions of a malware infection vector, which are the following: Speed     Stealth     Coverage     Shelf life 66 Part I: Malware Blueprint Depending on the attacker s needs, an infection vector is chosen based on these dimensions. It serves as a guide for the attacker on which appropriate infection vector should be chosen to deploy their malware. I then enumerated the most common infection vectors that are used by the attackers to deploy their malware. Physical media     E-mails     Instant messaging and chat     Social networking     URL links     File shares     Software vulnerabilities An infection vector can be coupled with or decoupled from the malware. A coupled infection vector can easily be revealed during malware analysis because the malware initiates the use of the vector. A decoupled vector is much more challenging to discover; because it is not initiated by the malware, no evidence of it will appear during analysis. The attackers usually initiate the use of a decoupled vector. It is important to note that most infection vectors used by attackers are legitimate services that are essential to the operation of any network system.",

Any technology can be used by attackers to deploy malware, which is why I concluded this chapter by discussing the potential of any technology to be used as an infection vector. It actually depends on the following characteristics: The ability to process data from an external source     The ability to move data to a chosen destination     The ability to share data Finding out which infection vector an attacker used to deploy malware completes the story of system compromise.

The deployment technology or malware infection vector can be intercepted, opening up the malware it is carrying to exposure. Once a malware is deployed, it always carries with it the risk of being captured. And once the malware is captured, it can then be analyzed, which is not a good thing for the attackers because this leads to the malware s behavior being understood and the malware technologies being discovered.

To avoid ratting itself out and revealing everything to researchers, the malware must have the ability to protect itself when captured. Malware employs different mechanisms to protect itself from the prying eyes of researchers and analysts. The protective mechanisms used by malware are designed to evade analysis and detection or at least buy some time long enough for it to achieve its directive. This is of paramount importance, especially if the malware is utilizing a new malware technology or a zero-day exploit. Discovery of this new technology and exploit by researchers and analyst can lead to the development of solutions not only against the current malware but also against future malware creations that will utilize these same malware technologies. Protective mechanisms are therefore designed to make it difficult for security products to detect the delivery, installation, and presence of malware and for researchers to analyze and uncover malware behavior and new malware technologies. In the case of researchers, the real goal of malware is to make unraveling the protective mechanisms so challenging and time-consuming that it is next to impossible. In this chapter, I will discuss the different protective mechanisms employed by malware and how malware applies these evasion techniques while it is being deployed and while it is running in a target system. Understanding how a malware protects itself and familiarizing yourself with the different technologies a malware uses to protect itself is key to removing these protective mechanisms so malware analysis can proceed.

Dynamic malware is malware in motion, which means that the malware is running or currently being executed in the system it is in. NOTE These two states are not exclusive to malware. These two states apply to all executables, benign or malicious. Malware must be able to protect itself regardless of what state it is in. Attackers know this to be true. A malware before it is executed will always be in a static state first. For it to be able to achieve dynamic state, it must be able to survive in a static state. Survival here means it is not detected by any security products and not easily analyzed by malware analysts and researchers. Once it reaches the dynamic state, the malware can then utilize other protective mechanisms that it is endowed with so it has enough time to achieve its directives. Static Malware A malware that is being transported by a deployment technology such as a physical drive or e-mail is a malware at rest. This is usually a good time to capture malware because it is powerless in this state. It cannot do anything to prevent anyone from copying it from the deployment technology and distributing it to other analysts and researchers for further analysis.

With it, analysts will be able to understand how the malware works and how to stop it. This is why static malware protective mechanisms are all about protecting the malware code.

Entry-Point Obscuring An entry point is a pointer to the location of an executable s first instruction. It points to the location where the execution formally starts. For a malware, the entry point almost always points to the start of the malware code. This is especially true for infected host files. Therefore, hiding it is advantageous for the malware because of the following: Antivirus (AV) scanners use the entry point to find the malware code and match the malware signatures the scanners have in their databases. With the entry point, reversers are able to disassemble and trace the code through the use of disassemblers and debuggers. Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 73 Hiding the malware code s entry point protects the malware from both analysis and scanning.

    "content": "Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 73 Hiding the malware code s entry point protects the malware from both analysis and scanning. The protective mechanism that hides a malware code s entry point is known as entry-point obscuring (EPO). The EPO technique is popular with file-infecting malware. This is because an infected file will always have two sets of code: the malware code and the original host file code. The trick is to hide the malware code by pointing to some benign code. To see how this works, you need to understand how a typical infected host file executes, as shown in Figure 4-1. When an infected host file is executed, the malware code gets executed first. This is because during infection, the malware modifies the target host file s entry point to point to the attached malware code. The main reason for this is to get initial control of the execution flow of the program. After the malware finishes execution, the control is passed back to the original host file code. This gives the impression that there is nothing wrong because the host file is still executed. This behavior of file-infecting malware makes it easy for analysts to locate the malware code because it is always the first code being pointed to by the infected host file s entry point. But EPO malware does things differently. The entry point does not point directly to the malware code; instead, it points to something different. A good illustration of this is an EPO technique that uses code patching, as shown in Figure 4-2. Instead of passing control immediately to the malware, the EPO malware lets the host program execute some of its code, and then a few instructions later, a patched instruction passes control to the malware code.",

Basic Malware Encryption Encryption is a good way to hide code. It is used in legitimate software to prevent software piracy and cracking. If it works for legitimate software, it will surely work for malware. With EPO, you saw how malware tries to hide the location of its malicious code, but in malware encryption, the malware is actually protecting the whole malicious program. An encrypted malware has three components: The encryption decryption engine     The encryption decryption key     The malware code NOTE An encrypted program does not mean it is malicious.

Once the malware code has been decrypted, it then executes its directive. After that, control is passed back to the host program. This is the simplest form of malware encryption. Basic malware encryption was first used by file infectors to make their infections look different in form and structure from one another. During infection, as shown in Figure 4-4, the decrypted malware code is encrypted by the encryption decryption engine using a different encryption decryption key. The new key is usually taken from a series of bytes found in a fixed location of the host file being infected. The location is constant, but the series of bytes found in that location differs for each file. Since the key is different, the newly encrypted malware code looks different from other infections. No two infections are exactly alike. Once malware code encryption is complete, the newly encrypted malware code attaches itself to the host file. The main reason for malware encryption is to avoid detection using a single signature. Instead of AV companies pushing a single signature to detect all infections, it will be forced to push a 1: 1 ratio, which does not scale and is a totally ineffective way of solving this problem.",

The encryption decryption key was always different per infection, resulting in the encrypted malware code being different as well from previous infections. But the encryption decryption engine remained constant. Using the encryption decryption engine codes, security products were able to create a single signature to catch this basic form of malware encryption. Polymorphism Attackers recognized that an improvement had to be made from the basic malware encryption that they were using, so they introduced a new malware technology known as the mutation engine. The mutation engine, which is part of the malware code, basically alters the code of another application without changing the application s functions. With the introduction of the mutation engine, it is now possible to alter the encryption decryption engine code without changing its functionality. The three components are now different in every infection. This new form of malware encryption is known as polymorphism. As defined by Merriam-Webster, polymorphism is  the quality or state of existing in or assuming different forms. This is exactly what polymorphic malware is.",

Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 77 Still, polymorphic malware has a weakness, as shown in Figure 4-5. A polymorphic malware still needs to decrypt the encrypted malware code in memory, and every time the malware code is decrypted, it is constant. It shows its original form. This makes it possible for a signature to be created to detect the malware code in memory or through antivirus emulation techniques. Polymorphic malware is highly effective in defeating static scanning but not the more advanced dynamic scanning. Metamorphism The attackers had to come up with a way to counteract the AV technologies used to detect encrypted and polymorphic malware. And so they did. They introduced a new form of encrypted malware known as metamorphic malware, as shown in Figure 4-6. Recognizing that a paradigm shift was needed, the attackers approached the problem differently. They realized that they had a powerful technology on their side in the form of the mutation engine. Instead of working with the three components of malware encryption, they realized that the mutation engine could simply mutate the whole malware code itself.

With metamorphism, each malware infection is totally different, both on disk and in memory. Although almost perfect, metamorphic malware still has a weakness because for it to morph, it needs to analyze its own code and reassemble it to its new form. If the mutation engine can do this, the reversers can do it as well, but it takes a lot of time, and the formulated solution might be complicated for existing AV technologies. Anti-reversing A sure way to understand malware is through reversing. No matter the protective mechanism, reversing can shed light on how to beat it. The only enemies are time and effort. Depending on the malware s difficulty level, a reversing session can range from minutes to months. For example, when Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) was first used to pack and encrypt malware, it was pretty awesome. It enabled attackers to easily distribute malware with far lesser resistance from security products and the prying eyes of analysts and reversers. Almost all malware used it. But once the packing routine was reversed, unpacking a malware packed with UPX using OllyDbg takes only minutes. Plus, there are a lot of tools available for download that can unpack UPX in seconds.

If an attack campaign uses a malware that needs only a couple of days and it takes a reverser three days to solve that malware, the malware has already won. The main idea of anti-reversing is to make the reversing process as difficult as possible to the point that it seems impossible to reverse the malware. The most common anti-reversing techniques used to protect static malware are the following: Anti-decompilers     Anti-disassemblers If a reverser or the tools he uses cannot decompile or disassemble a malware, the reverser is denied access to the malware source code, and without the source code, reversing cannot proceed. But there is a drawback in this protective mechanism. It works only for decompilers and disassemblers supported by the malware. This is because decompilers and disassemblers, like other software products, have their own proprietary design, algorithm, and implementation. For example, a malware with anti-disassembler capability can support only the IDA disassembler but not others such as Win32DASM. So if a reverser uses IDA, it might not work as planned, but using Win32DASM might yield the output the reverser desires since the anti-disassembler technology used by the malware does not support Win32DASM.",

Usually, malware that uses anti-decompiler or anti-disassembler protective mechanisms supports the most popular tool that reversers use. Again, the main point is to make life difficult for reversers. It takes the reversers more time and effort to reverse the malware. And if the malware is able to achieve this, that is, buy more time for the malware to finish its directive, then the anti-reversing protective mechanism has done its job. NOTE Entry-point obfuscation, code obfuscation through encryption, polymorphism, and metamorphism also slow down reversing. So, in effect, these protective mechanisms can also be viewed as antireversing technologies. Dynamic Malware Protective Mechanisms When a malware is in motion, i. e. , running in the system, it has the full capabilities of its code. This means, when executing, the malware has available to it whatever protective mechanism it is endowed with by its writer. 80 Part I: Malware Blueprint The following are the most common protective mechanisms employed by dynamic malware: Anti-debugging     Anti-sandboxing     Environment lock     Anti-AV scanning     Network behavior protection Anti-debugging One of the most effective ways of tracing malware is to use a debugger. This enables a reverser to follow the malware as it executes per line of code, look at the contents of memory and the system s registers, and examine the changes done to the system by the malware. Debugging is an important part of reversing. Without it, it is extremely hard to do a reversing session.",

The main goal of anti-debugging is to fool the debugger into following a deadend execution flow, making it difficult for the reverser. The more difficult it is, the more time and effort that are needed. Sometimes, this is more than enough for the malware to be successful. TIP It is always good to have disassembled code available while doing a debugging session. This is a good way to check for inconsistencies between the disassembled code and the actual execution path the debugger is taking. Anti-sandboxing In rare cases, static analysis is enough to extract information from malware that reveals its directive, but in most cases dynamic analysis is needed. As defined in Chapter 1, dynamic analysis is the process of extracting information from malware through the use of system monitoring tools and technologies. Usually, dynamic analysis is done by using a sandbox. A sandbox can be manually driven, or it can be automated. The following are the two most important components of a sandbox: Sandbox environment     System monitoring tools Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 81 The sandbox environment is the system where the malware is executed. During execution, the malware is supposed to do what it was designed to do. The system monitoring tools make sure that everything the malware does on the system is captured and logged for analysis purposes. If the malware does not execute in the sandbox, no information is extracted, and the whole process fails. This is the key to beating a sandbox.

So, for malware to know whether it is running in a sandbox, it needs to know only whether it is running in a virtualized environment. This led to the most popular anti-sandboxing technology: the anti-virtualization technique. This technique simply detects telltale signs common to virtual machines. If the malware senses any indication of it running in a virtualized environment, it will simply exit and do nothing. NOTE Malware programs with only anti-virtualization techniques are often used for opportunistic attacks, which result in more home users being infected because most of them are not using virtualized systems.",

Detection of System Monitoring Tools Not all sandboxes are implemented in a virtualized environment. Bare-metal sandbox implementations are available as well. This solves the anti-virtualization technique employed by most malware, but it costs more to implement, and restoring images takes longer compared to the virtualized counterpart. As previously mentioned, a sandbox has two important components: the sandbox environment and the system monitoring tools. Without the system monitoring tools, no information can be extracted from the running malware. In bare-metal implementations, a malware relies on detecting the presence of system monitoring tools. This is the opening the malware writers have to beat bare-metal sandbox implementations. As with other software, system monitoring tools leave telltale signs or footprints in the system whether they are running or not. The malware writers simply familiarize themselves with these tools and the footprints they leave in the system and arm their malware with the ability to detect the presence of these footprints. If a malware detects the presence of any of these telltale signs, it exits and does nothing.",

NOTE Some instances of malware, especially malware used in targeted attacks, will stop execution only if they detect system monitoring tools running, because most enterprise production systems are virtualized. Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 83 Environment Lock Malware is designed primarily to execute to do its job. If it does not execute in the target system, then it has failed. But it must be intelligent enough to know whether it is running in a target system or in a malware test environment. Most of the time, malware is captured from a compromised system. It is then subjected to static and dynamic analysis to extract information from it. The environment lock feature protects the malware from dynamic analysis. The main idea of this protective mechanism is to have the malware execute only in the environment it initially compromised. Getting that malware out of that environment and have it execute in any other system, be it a sandbox or just another system, will not work. This is because during its first execution on its target system, the malware takes environment-specific markers such as the hardware ID, media access control (MAC) address, or anything that is unique to the system as variables or encryption keys and mutates itself by using these keys, which then become the conditions for its execution. The resulting mutated malware will run only in the first compromised system and nowhere else. If the malware is moved to another system and the system-specific markers do not match, it will not be able to decrypt its code in memory and execute. Capturing a malware with an environment lock feature and subjecting it to a sandbox for dynamic analysis will not yield any result.",

Anti-AV Scanning The malware s foremost nemesis has always been the AV product, and malware writers know that their creations can be beaten if AV is able to scan and detect them. Detection depends on the signatures the AV product has. It can specifically detect and identify a malware if there is a signature that matches the malware s characteristics. For malware that is totally new and not covered by any specific detection, the AV product uses heuristic detection. Depending on how the heuristic signature is written and the number of malware samples that a heuristic signature is based upon, it can be effective or not. And to ensure that the system is always protected, real-time scanning is always enabled. This is an AV feature that lets it reside in memory, keeping a watchful eye on the file system on disk and the programs loaded and executed in memory. A malware can arrive in a target system in different ways; it depends on the deployment technology used. The malware can be downloaded from the Internet or can arrive as an attachment in e-mail. If this is the case, the malware typically undergoes static scanning. Obviously, static scanning is easy to defeat given the 84 Part I: Malware Blueprint available static malware protective mechanisms the attackers use.

So, almost all the time, malware gets into the system undetected. Once the malware is executed in the target system, the AV product uses dynamic scanning to inspect the malware during runtime. Depending on the current signature database of the AV product, the malware might get detected using specific or heuristic detection. But before any signature matching takes place, the AV scanner must be able to find the malware code. It does not matter whether it s static or dynamic scanning; the scanning flow is the same, which is to find the right entry point to the malware code. The only difference is that in dynamic scanning, the memory image of the malware is the one that is being scanned. Given that the scanning flow is the same, some code obfuscation techniques that worked in protecting static malware also work in protecting dynamic malware. The most effective protective mechanism techniques that usually work for both states of malware are entry-point obscuring and metamorphism. Another anti-AV scanning technology used by malware to protect itself from scanning is to simply turn off the AV product altogether and deny access to AV vendors  websites. The same concept as the one used in detecting the presence of system monitoring tools is applied, but this time, the presence of AV products is the one being detected. Once detected, the malware turns off the AV product. This works only if the malware is totally new and not detected by the installed AV product.

The malware simply adds itself to that list so every time a scan is performed, the security product will skip the malware. Again, this works only if the malware is new and not detected when it first compromises the target system. Network Behavior Protection With the rise of botnets and the agility it offers to attackers, most malware used in attack campaigns must have the capability to communicate to the attacker. Communication can be one-way or two-way. One-way communication means the malware can accept commands or directives only from the attackers, while two-way communication means the malware not only has the capability to accept commands but also can post status updates or any other information that the attacker needs. When a malware is running in a compromised system, the most common way it communicates to its command-and-control (C C) is through the use of domains. Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 85 LINGO Command-and-control is also known as CnC, C C, or C2. Every time a malware communicates, it leaves network traces. Network logs can see what domains it connects to, and network sniffers can tell what data it is sending and receiving. Because of this, domains that are used as C C are collected and can be added to a blacklist to be used to detect the presence of malware in the network. An endpoint that attempts to communicate to any of these known malicious domains will be flagged and disconnected from the network for analysis purposes. This effectively kills what the malware is trying to do.",

This effectively kills what the malware is trying to do. No matter how good the malware is at hiding or protecting itself in the endpoint, its network behavior is enough to betray it and shout to the whole world of its existence. Because of this, attackers have devised ways of protecting their malware s network behavior from detection and analysis. The following technologies are commonly used to accomplish this: Domain fluxing     Internet Protocol (IP) fluxing     Abusing legitimate services Domain Fluxing When the first botnets came out, most malware used in these botnets had hard-coded domains; therefore, once these domains were discovered, all instances of that malware could easily be detected using a domain blacklist technology. There was no need to invest time in doing forensics in a suspected infected host or endpoint. The domains decided the endpoint s guilt. And most of the time, this was enough. If the endpoint was not critical, some organizations would simply restore it to an original clean state. This saved them effort and time in restoration. Attackers understood that this was a major weakness even for the most sophisticated malware, so they came out with domain fluxing. Domain fluxing is the ability of malware to generate unique domain names on regular intervals, usually a day. This is made possible by a domain generation algorithm (DGA) that is coded into the malware. With this protective mechanism, the domain blacklist is rendered useless because whatever is added on a certain day becomes obsolete the next day. 86 Part I: Malware Blueprint The most infamous malware that utilizes DGA is Conficker.",

Conficker. A and Conficker. B can generate 500 unique domain names in a day, while Conficker. C can generate 50, 000 unique domain names in a day. It is important to note that not all of these domains are active. Out of the large number of domain names produced, only a handful or even a single one will be active. The rest are NXDOMAINS. This is one flaw of this technique because an endpoint that attempts to connect to massive amounts of NXDOMAINS can trigger a network rule and thus be flagged for suspicious activity. LINGO NXDOMAINS is short for non-existent domains. IP Fluxing IP fluxing refers to having a single domain name resolve to a frequently changing IP address. This protective mechanism, when combined with domain fluxing, can be a powerful anti-detection and anti-takedown protection. With a rotating IP address, identifying (and taking down) the C C server is challenging. LINGO IP fluxing is also known as fast fluxing. This protective mechanism beats IP blacklists but not domain blacklists, especially if the malware does not use this capability together with domain fluxing. This is because this protective mechanism is geared toward hiding the C C and not the malware itself. Abusing Legitimate Services Another way for malware to hide its network communications is by using known and legitimate services within the network.

This is also true for wall postings and updates on other social media networks. A malware can even utilize free hosting services to get updates or commands from attackers. Network rules and policies may not raise an alert to any of these network communications because they are known to be legitimate, and the domains the malware are Chapter 4: Protective Mechanisms 87 connecting to are popular domains that are known to be benign.

In some cases, malware execution can stall or proceed only in parts, meaning that only a few functions execute while the rest do not. And in malware analysis, you want the malware to execute all functions. Chapter 5: Malware Dependencies 91 The reason for non-execution or partial execution of malware is known as malware dependencies. Just like any other software, malware has dependencies for it to function properly. Think of scanning software that has all the bells and whistles to enable a user to scan from any printer or from a mobile device camera, with the scanned object saved directly to a computer. Without the main drivers that enable it to communicate with the hardware used for scanning, the software will not function as intended. Another example is a script that reads social media messages and then displays the messages on a customized user interface. Even if the script is flawlessly written but executed in a system without the library to support the social media protocol, it will not work.",

Even if the script is flawlessly written but executed in a system without the library to support the social media protocol, it will not work. This is true for malware, as well. Without the presence of its dependencies, it will not function normally. In this chapter, I will discuss the different malware dependencies that influence the successful execution of malware. Understanding these dependencies is key to creating an effective, controlled environment for malware dynamic analysis. Dependency Types Malware, like any other software, has dependencies for it to function properly. The more sophisticated the malware is, the more dependencies it has. This is true especially for malware used for targeted attacks. For example, a malware that will be used to attack Organization A will be designed to run only in endpoints present in Organization A. The malware is able to accomplish this by adding a dependency that is present only in Organization A s endpoints. An example dependency is a logged-in username. If the username is preceded by ORGA and has the format ORGA username, then the malware assumes that it is running in an endpoint in Organization A and thus will function according to plan. NOTE Malware dependencies can be intended or unintended. They are intended if the attacker needs them as conditions or triggers, and they are unintended if the attacker designed the malware in a controlled lab and failed to take into consideration that not all the dependencies the malware needs to run are present in a target system.",

Then again, it would be easy for the attackers too. The way a malware operates is confined within the environment s digital physics. This is true for all software as well. Each environment has its own rules of digital physics. As a consequence of this, a malware written for one environment will not function in another environment. It is as simple as that. NOTE Most malware writers design their malware to be environment-agnostic by piggybacking on popular programs used across different environments such as a multi-platform web browser. Therefore, for a malware to successfully execute, it must be running in the right environment. Dependency on the system environment is the most critical dependency of all.

It is a software platform that manages hardware, peripherals, and any other resources the system uses. Without it, no application would be able to run or communicate with any hardware resources such as the keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

In some cases, a malware will run on a Windows system only with the latest service pack, or in the case of older malware, they might run properly only with older service packs installed. This is because service packs introduce several updates and bug fixes that might impact or close the holes that malware exploits to execute properly. Service packs also modify some system structure that renders old malware to be useless because the new structure is unsupported by the malware code. For example, disabling autorun, which is covered under the Security Advisory (SA) 967940 update, has contributed to a decline in the autorun capability exploiting malware and having sandboxes with this update installed will not be able to properly see the autorun capabilities of these types of malware. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of service pack changes that might affect malware execution. TIP Always keep different OS flavors and service packs on hand. You never know when you will need them. An executable written for a specific operating system will have a format specific to that operating system. Only the operating system it is written for will be able to understand that specific file format and thus execute the file. This is a good way to determine whether a certain executable will run in a target system. There are lots of tools that can be used to determine an executable s file format. This enables you to know whether the file is worth analyzing in the first place. For example, an executable file determined to be a Linux executable is of no interest to you if you are concentrating on Windows executable files. If this is the case, you do not need to analyze the file further.",

If this is the case, you do not need to analyze the file further. 94 Part I: Malware Blueprint In automated malware analysis systems, this is an important process in weeding out files. Executable files or any other file format that is not supported by the automated malware analysis system will not be submitted anymore. These files will be discarded, which saves sandbox resources. Say a system receives 100, 000 samples a day, but 30 percent of those samples are unsupported. If each file is processed for 30 seconds in the sandbox, then weeding out those files saves the system 900, 000 seconds, or 250 hours. System Settings System settings are another important aspect of successfully executing malware. A restrictive setting might not be a good idea when it comes to providing malware with an environment to properly run on. Although some malware is designed to circumvent even the most restrictive settings, it is still a good idea to make a malware test environment more malware friendly. This also includes a more relaxed setting for other key programs that malware utilizes, such as Internet browsers. TIP In some cases, malware will expect a more restrictive setting, especially if it is written for targeted attacks. If this is the case, always keep environment images with restrictive settings. You can find the Windows 7 security settings in the Control Panel, as shown in Figure 5-1.

User Account Control (UAC) will need to be disabled as well so the malware can make whatever changes it needs to the system during installation or infection. Virtualization You can implement a malware test environment in two ways: virtualized and bare metal. Most implementations are virtualized because those implementations are cheaper (one machine can host multiple guest OSs) and faster to restore.

TIP When people ask me which implementation I prefer, I always tell them that I run an unknown malware in a virtualized environment first, and when nothing happens, then I use my bare-metal environment. Program Dependencies Malware that has specific functions most of the time has program dependencies. Some malware utilizes specific programs for it to achieve its directive. The programs or applications the malware depends on are usually common on systems that are used regularly but not in dynamic analysis systems. This is the reason why malware runs successfully in a victim system but not in a test environment. To mitigate this, the test environment or malware analysis system must mimic a system that is used for everyday computing. Familiarizing yourself with the often-used program utilized by malware will help you in setting up a test environment that is as close to a real-world computing system that is being used regularly. For example, most mass-mailing worms need the presence of an e-mail client. If no e-mail client is installed, they will not work. The malware will not be able to send copies of itself through e-mail. The most common e-mail client that is often abused by malware is Outlook. Having Outlook installed in a target system will help in satisfying this program dependency. But simply having Outlook may not be enough. In most cases, a mass-mailer malware will need to read an existing address book to know where to send copies of itself. An empty address book will not work; the address book must have entries. TIP Put entries in the address book of a malware test environment that point to e-mails that you control.",

This will help you determine whether the mass-mailer is a success and what kind of e-mail is being sent. This is good for formulating an anti-spam solution. Chapter 5: Malware Dependencies 97 Attackers understand that not all target systems will have Outlook, especially those systems that are owned by home users. If this is the case, mass-mailers will often utilize Outlook Express, which comes with Windows. To make sure that the malware can successfully utilize it, Outlook Express must be configured, and the address book must be populated. Take note that newer versions of Windows do not have Outlook Express anymore, but if the test environment uses a flavor of Windows with Outlook Express, it must be configured to make the system more malware friendly. Another popular program that malware is often dependent on is the Internet browser. Everybody who owns or has access to a computer, be it a desktop or mobile device, will always use an Internet browser. This is why the browser is also arguably the most abused program. It is not only used as a dependency but also used as an infection vector for malware. An Internet browser is also a good candidate for exploitation by the attackers, especially if it has lots of vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit any of the Internet browser s known vulnerabilities and deploy a malware to a target system.

    "content": "The presence of vulnerabilities is not the only reason why Internet browsers are important to attackers. Going back to program dependency, Internet browsers are our windows to the Internet. Browsers enable all of us to access web-based services such as webmail and social networks. A malware that wants to minimize program dependency on something that is already installed on a possible target system that almost everybody uses finds Internet browsers an attractive candidate. For example, a malware that wants to spam e-mails can hook into an Internet browser so that every time a user logs in to a webmail service, the malware can take over and send spammed copies of itself to the contact lists of the compromised user and even reply automatically to new e-mails that are received. It is therefore important to have an analysis system where malware like this is submitted to have an Internet browser running and logged in to an active and controlled webmail account. Another example of a malware that finds Internet browsers useful is one that uses social networks as an infection vector. These types of malware rely on a user to be logged in to a certain social network for the malware to function properly. For example, the Trojan known as Febipos takes advantage of a victim s Facebook account once it compromises the target machine. As described by Microsoft, it performs several social network related tasks such as liking a page, sharing a post, posting messages, joining a group, inviting friends to a group, commenting on posts, and sending messages and links via chat. For malware with similar behavior, it is important to fire up an Internet browser first and then log in to a controlled social network account on the analysis system before the malware is executed.",

TIP Always keep a collection of different versions of often-exploited programs just in case they aren t available for download anymore. Having familiarity with how malware uses the different programs it is dependent on ensures that it will execute as intended in the malware analysis system. A good malware test environment must have all or some of these programs installed to increase the chance of the malware executing properly and the analyst collecting data from the dynamic malware. Timing Dependencies Timing is everything. This is also true for malware. Depending on the attack, a malware might go dormant for a significant amount of time before striking, or it can strike immediately after it has taken hold of a target system. Timing dependencies usually have to do with a malware payload. A malware payload is a malware function that reveals what it really is. It can be considered a malware s main directive. For example, a malware with a payload of deleting all files in the system can be considered a Trojan because of its destructive directive. It is important to determine what a malware s payload is because it enables researchers and analysts to come up with preventive measures and solutions to mitigate it.",

    "content": "It is important to determine what a malware s payload is because it enables researchers and analysts to come up with preventive measures and solutions to mitigate it. Execution of a malware payload can be instant, or it can be based on a specific condition such as date and time, which is known as a time trigger. A malware might wait for a certain time in the day to execute its payload. For example, a malware might trigger its information-stealing function every 3 a. m. when nobody is around. Or the malware might wait for a specific date to activate its payload. The Conficker worm actually grabbed headlines years ago that it was going to trigger some mysterious payload on April 1. Nothing happened. April 1 is April Fool s Day after all. TIP To check whether a system is infected by Conficker, use the Conficker Eye Chart located at www. confickerworkinggroup. org infection_test cfeyechart. html. Chapter 5: Malware Dependencies 99 A timing dependency can also mean dormancy, where the malware sleeps or does nothing for a certain amount of time. This can range from minutes to even months. This is a common evasive technique against automated malware analysis systems. An analysis system gives malware only a limited time to execute. It is usually 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Because of this timing dependency, the malware will not execute, and therefore no malware activity will be recorded. This is why it is wise to have a manually driven analysis system for special malware such as malware with a timing dependency. A telltale sign that a malware might have a timing dependency is a function that enables it to determine the local system time. In the old days, it was easy to manipulate malware that had timing dependencies.",

A telltale sign that a malware might have a timing dependency is a function that enables it to determine the local system time. In the old days, it was easy to manipulate malware that had timing dependencies. A simple change in the system date and time to coincide with the malware s trigger usually did the trick. Obviously, the malware writers were aware of this. The malware writers knew that system date and time could be manipulated, especially in malware-testing environments. To mitigate this, the attackers programmed their malware to check Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to determine the real current date and time. NTP synchronizes the time across computer systems. Of course, malware checking NTP servers works only if the compromised system is online. Event Dependencies As I discussed in the previous section, the execution of a malware payload can depend on timing. It can be instant, or it might take a longer period of time. The exact time or length of time before a malware executes its function or payload is called a time trigger. But this is not the only trigger there is. There is also another that is based on a specific condition. This condition can be an event or series of events. It is called an event trigger. An event can be anything that goes on inside the system. Some examples are pressing a key, clicking the mouse, moving the mouse pointer to a certain location, putting the system to sleep, shutting down, and starting up. These events can trigger a malware payload.",

These events can trigger a malware payload. For example, On Windows, a key press combination of Alt Prtscrn is used to capture the active window as an image in the clipboard. An information stealer malware might use this as an event trigger to save the current clipboard for later exfiltration. A more complex event can be the execution of an Internet browser followed by a series of keystrokes that spells out an online banking site. This event can trigger a keylogger, desktop capturer, or memory scraper with the purpose of stealing banking credentials. An event can also be outside the system. For example, a social media or website update can be considered an event. If a certain monitored social media 100 Part I: Malware Blueprint site or website posts something that triggers a malware to act, then that posting is considered a malware trigger event. This is especially useful for botnets that are utilized for spamming jobs. A botnet agent can simply monitor a specific product s website for an announcement, and once an announcement is done, the botnet sends out its spam e-mails that could be carrying malware. For example, if the botnet wants to send spam about a new Apple product, it can simply monitor Apple s website for any announcement of a new product and then trigger its spam to potential victims announcing that they have won that new product and all the user needs to do is to click a link to claim the prize or download or double-click an attachment.",

Malware that has event dependencies is challenging when submitted to an automated analysis system. The only time an automated analysis system will succeed in executing the malware is when all of the events are satisfied and thus triggering the malware. In actual practice, malware with event dependencies is often analyzed manually to fully understand its capabilities. Only then will those events be added to an automated analysis system. Spotting malware that has event dependencies depends on the functions it exhibits. Malware that has functions monitoring any system events or external resource such as online feeds will likely have a payload that is event-triggered. User Dependencies Some malware depends on targeted users to achieve its directives. It takes advantage of users in two ways, as follows: Compromise accomplice     Roles and access Compromise Accomplice As much as possible, malware writers want their malware to be able to compromise a target without any form of user interaction. The more silent and hidden the malware is, the less chance it has of being detected. But there are cases where malware needs the user to accomplish its task, and as a result, the users become accomplices to the infection of their own systems. Users being used by malware as unwitting accomplices to its initial stage of compromise is nothing new.",

Some malware has always been dependent upon the users to do what the malware cannot do such as bypassing security features that only the user can disable. This is especially true when malware needs the user to Chapter 5: Malware Dependencies 101 click buttons for the malware installation to proceed. Scareware such as fake AV malware is notorious for this. Since it has disguised itself as a legitimate security product to fool the user, the user simply clicks whatever the malware wants the user to click to have the fake AV malware installed on the system. This is a good method of bypassing Windows UAC. Socially engineering the user to grant the malware administrator rights is one sure way of getting the malware installed on the target system. For this type of user dependency to be successful, the malware must be able to fool users through social engineering or scare tactics, which are techniques used by scareware, and get them to do anything that the malware or disguised malware wants them to do. Roles and Access Malware user dependency is not confined to users clicking buttons or being victims of malware social engineering tactics. Sometimes malware infects a target system based on user roles or a user s position in the company. In this case, a malware targets a system based on what kind of user has access to that system.

This is something the company does not mind leaking to the public because it has little value or will not affect the company s business in anyway if it gets stolen. One example of a non-critical user is a front-desk employee, who has access only to scheduling data.",

One example of a non-critical user is a front-desk employee, who has access only to scheduling data. Attacking this role may lead only to systems with minimal sensitive data or no sensitive data at all. The danger is only when the system s non-critical users use or have access to a network that has systems connected to it that contain sensitive data. File Dependencies Malware that steals information, also known as information stealers, is the most common type of malware that has file dependencies, especially malware designed to steal documents. This type of information stealer functions by enumerating files inside the Documents folder or any folder where documents are saved. It then proceeds to compare the names of the documents to keywords that the malware has coded in its code or found in a configuration file that the malware is using. A few example keywords are financial, salary, report, employee, incentive, and so on. If a file matches any of these keywords, the malware will send copies of the matching document to a drop zone that is controlled by the attacker. Another method of picking which documents to steal is through filename extensions. An information stealer, instead of using keywords, will just send copies of all documents that have extensions of. DOC, . DOCX, . XLS, . XLSX, . PPT, . PPTX, . PNG, . JPG, . TIF, and so on. Attackers understand that these files are data heavy, which is why exfiltration of stolen information is sometimes done not in bulk but in a staggered way.",

The only drawback of this is that once the malware is found and stopped, the attacker is left with corrupted data. 106 Part I: Malware Blueprint NOTE Information stealers also target graphic files, especially if the attack is against a publication company. In most cases, this behavior of information stealers can be triggered only by the presence of these files. It is therefore important to have documents and graphic files present in a sandbox environment to entice information stealers to activate their file-stealing capabilities. But be mindful of document sizes also; most information stealers have a checking mechanism. The checking mechanism has to do with size. If the files have 0 bytes, nothing will happen. So, it is important for these dummy files to have dummy information inside them. During analysis, if the dummy files suddenly disappear, it means that the information stealer has a destructive functionality. This functionality is activated once a copy of the stolen file has been exfiltrated. The information stealer deletes the files from the compromised machine, leaving the victim with nothing.

A malware research lab consists of different systems that have a special purpose, the most common of which are the following: Malware collection lab     Static analysis lab     Dynamic analysis lab A malware collection lab is a system or collection of systems designed solely to collect malware samples from different sources. A static analysis lab is designed to gather data from malware while it is at rest, and a dynamic analysis lab is designed to gather data from malware while it is in motion. In this chapter, I will concentrate on malware collection. I will discuss the different sources of malware samples and the ways of collecting them from these sources. The following are the most common sources of malware samples: Your own backyard     Free sources     Research mailing lists     Sample exchange     Commercial sources     Honeypots Before malware analysis can begin, you must have malware samples on hand. Malware has to be available. It is therefore important that you first familiarize yourself with the different sources of malware. Chapter 6: Malware Collection 111 Your Own Backyard Before you look any further, it s always better to look somewhere close to home. Systems that are in  your own backyard  are a good source of malware samples. These are systems you have at home and those that belong to your friends and relatives. Have you ever been called by your non-tech-savvy friends, siblings, cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, parents, or even grandparents and asked for help to solve whatever issues they were having with their computers?

So, these systems that are in  your own backyard  are good sources of malware samples. Not only do you have a good source of malware, but you can see the malware in action in a target environment outside of a controlled malware analysis system. In other words, you are seeing the malware in the wild. Once you have access to an infected system and can see the malware in action, the next best thing to do is to extract the sample from the infected system. This is easier said than done. Collecting malware from infected systems is different from analyzing malware. In malware analysis, you have an idea which suspicious or malicious binary or process is running; therefore, it is easy to monitor and account for the changes it makes on the target system. In malware collection, you have no idea what binary or process is causing the infection. Finding extracting malicious files from an infected machine requires a different set of skills. It requires skills in system forensics, which are important skills for a malware incident responder to have. But sometimes extracting the malware is easy, such as when e-mail is used by the attackers as the malware deployment technology. E-mail is the most common malware deployment technology, and the e-mail attack vector can be carrying the malicious file or a link to a drive-by download site. In cases like this, you can easily extract and collect the malware for analysis purposes.",

In cases like this, you can easily extract and collect the malware for analysis purposes. But if there are no traces of any malware deployment technology and the malware is already live in the system, then you need to use special tools to determine where the malware is hiding in the system so it can be extracted. Although system forensics is beyond the scope of this book, I will list the steps to help you identify and extract malware from an infected system and show some tools you can use during each step. NOTE The only difference between a live infected or compromised system and a controlled malware analysis environment is that the compromised system is not isolated. You can use the same tools for dynamic analysis as for live compromised systems. 112 Part II: Malware Research Lab The following steps will help you identify and extract malware from an infected system: 1. Scan for malicious files. 2. Look for active rootkits. 3. Inspect startup programs. 4. Inspect running processes. 5. Extract suspicious files. Scan for Malicious Files The first thing to do when identifying which file is possibly malicious is to use an antivirus (AV) scanner. If the victimized system has an AV product installed and the malware is already active, chances are the AV product installed in the system will not detect the malware. If this is the case, try updating the installed antivirus product s signature database. If detection yields nothing even after the update, you will use other alternatives such as using free online scanning services.

Chapter 6: Malware Collection 113 Look for Active Rootkits If the antivirus scanning does not reveal anything, there are a couple of reasons for this. One is that the malware is new, and there is no signature available to detect it yet. The other is that the malware can be employing a rootkit technology. One or both of these reasons can apply to a specific malware that is undetected in the system. If the malware is new, which is more likely, then it may or may not be using a rootkit technology. If it is not using a rootkit technology, then it makes it easier to determine which binary is the culprit and extract it.

Figure 6-2 TDSSKiller scan result. 116 Part II: Malware Research Lab The following are the most common boot analyzer tools: GMER http: www. gmer. net     MbrScan http: eric71. geekstogo. com tools MbrScan. exe     MBR Backup: http: www. trojanhunter. com products mbr-backup      Boot Sector Explorer http: www. pendriveapps. com boot-sectorexplorer-backup-and-restore-mbr  The previous two tools are good for getting an image of the MBR and the boot sector. At Nate s MBR and Boot Sector Analyzer webpage (http: www. aqfire. com boot ), you can upload an image for analysis. Another way to image an MBR or a boot sector is by using hex editors. Lots of hex editors are available, but the most popular and a favorite of mine is WinHex. You can download it from http: www. winhex. com disk-editor. html. Figure 6-3 Microsoft Autoruns filter. Chapter 6: Malware Collection 117 These are but a sampling of MBR and boot sector tools. There are many more available for download, but please be careful when using these tools. You have to be fully aware of their capabilities and the risks they carry. TIP It is good practice to treat free tools as suspicious and analyze them to determine whether there are hidden functionalities that will prove detrimental to the user s system.",

TIP It is good practice to treat free tools as suspicious and analyze them to determine whether there are hidden functionalities that will prove detrimental to the user s system. Inspect Running Processes Any software, including malware, running in a system has its own process space. The challenge here is to determine which software is the malware. To do this, you need to inspect a good number of running processes on the system. Figure 6-4 Comodo Autorun Analyzer, Hide Safe Entries menu. 118 Part II: Malware Research Lab To inspect running processes, you can use the following tools: Process Explorer by Microsoft http: technet. microsoft. com en-us  sysinternals bb896653. aspx     KillSwitch by Comodo http: www. comodo. com business-security  network-protection cleaning_essentials. php Both tools give the user the ability to dig deeper into a process. Which tool to use depends on the user s preference. The thing I like about Microsoft Autoruns is the ability to save a process  image in memory, and the things I like about Comodo Autorun Analyzer are its performance graphs and the option to show only unsafe images in memory. Familiarizing yourself with these tools will go a long way in determining a possibly malicious process. Similar to Autorun Analyzer, KillSwitch, as shown in Figure 6-5, is part of Comodo Cleaning Essentials. To open this tool, go to the Tools menu and select Open KillSwitch. Another alternative of running KillSwitch is to go to the folder where CCE is installed and double-click KillSwitch. EXE.",

TIP You must read the terms and conditions of the tools carefully and understand the consequences or effect of using these tools. They might have an unintended effect on the system if used improperly. Extract Suspicious Files Once the suspicious files have been identified by using the different tools and going through the steps listed earlier, it is time to extract the files. In most cases, extracting the files is easier than copying them to external media. But there are instances where the active malware will prevent you from doing this, especially if it has full control of the system. The malware can simply put special permissions on all malware components to prevent them from being copied. If this is the case, one way to extract the malware or suspicious files is by booting the infected system using a different operating system (OS). Good OS candidates are Linuxbased distributions such as Ubuntu. This negates whatever special permissions the malware assigned to the malware components, and therefore the files will be easier to extract. How to create an Ubuntu boot disk is described in later chapters. It is possible that you will end up with a bunch of suspicious files if there is not enough evidence to discount some of them. These extracted files are the ones to Chapter 6: Malware Collection 119 subject to malware analysis to determine which of them are malware and which of them are not. The steps just outlined are just a small taste of what is needed to identify and extract malware from an infected system.",

Sample exchange is done on a periodic basis, usually weekly or monthly. The main idea here is that all members of the sample exchange dump all of the new malware samples that they have collected during a given time period and then organize them in a way that follows the agreed-upon sample exchange protocols; in return, they get access to the samples being shared by the other members. The main reason why security companies do sample exchange is to make sure all users are protected regardless of who their security provider is. In my opinion, this is a noble activity by security companies since it is more about providing protection than making a profit. Another advantage of being a security professional is that if you work for a security company that is involved in some sort of sample exchange, then there is no need to exert much effort in other ways of procuring malware samples for research purposes. Commercial Sources Malware samples, especially fresh ones, are considered commodities. This is why there are businesses out there that sell malware samples to vetted companies for the purpose of research. These commercial sources of malware usually specialize in the collection of malware in the wild. They build their malware collection with the sole purpose of selling the malware. Purchasing malware samples from these sources is sometimes the most practical way for a company that is doing malware research to get malware samples. Instead Chapter 6: Malware Collection 139 of investing time and money in building systems to collect malware, it is often much more feasible to just buy them.",

Sometimes the juice is not worth the squeeze; it is like outsourcing the process of building and maintaining systems to collect malware to a commercial source. Honeypots Even with the different sources available to get your hands on malware samples, it is always better to learn how to build systems that collect malware. In malware collection, honeypots are the main systems used to collect malware automatically. As defined in most literature, 1 a honeypot is an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource. The idea behind this methodology is to lure in attackers such as automated malware. As a consequence, the automated malware used in the attack can be collected and then studied in detail. There are two general types of honeypots. 2     Low-interaction     High-interaction Low-interaction honeypots2 offer limited services to the attacker. They emulate services or operating systems, and the level of interaction varies with the implementation. The risk tends to be low. In addition, deploying maintaining these honeypots tends to be easy. With the help of low-interaction honeypots, it is possible to learn more about attack patterns and attacker behavior. High-interaction honeypots, on the other hand, offer the attacker a real system to interact with. More risk is involved when deploying a high-interaction honeypot; for example, special provisions are created to prevent attacks against systems that are not involved in the setup. They are normally more complex to set up and maintain.",

They are normally more complex to set up and maintain. NOTES Low-interaction honeypots are emulated, while high-interaction honeypots are real systems. Depending on the need, a honeypot system can be emulated or implemented as a real system. There are pros and cons to this. Low-interaction honeypots have 2 Malware, Rootkits   Botnets by Christopher C. Elisan, published by McGraw-Hill. 140 Part II: Malware Research Lab fewer risks of infection than high-interaction ones. Deployment and maintenance are easier in low-interaction honeypots compared to high-interaction honeypots, making low-interaction honeypots more scalable. But one advantage a highinteraction honeypot has over a low-interaction honeypot is the ability to study the attack in more detail because high-interaction honeypots, being based on a real system, offer full system functionality, making high-interaction honeypots much more expressive. In other words, low-interaction honeypots score high on scalability, while high-interaction honeypots score high on expressiveness. Dionaea Dionaea offers both of these advantages: the scalability of low-interaction honeypots and the expressiveness of high-interaction honeypots. Dionaea, as defined by its creator, is a system intended to trap malware that exploits vulnerabilities exposed by services offered to a network with the ultimate goal of gaining a copy of the malware. NOTES Before Dionaea, there was Nepenthes. But it is not available in most repositories anymore.

Recap In this chapter, I defined what a malware research lab is and the common purpose it serves. The following are the types of labs: Malware collection lab     Static analysis lab     Dynamic analysis lab In addition, I concentrated the discussion on one purpose of the malware research lab: malware collection. I enumerated the different sources of malware and showed that not all of them require a lab setup, but it is always good practice to browse online malware sources from a system that is totally isolated and is designed solely for the purpose of collecting malware.

But one thing is certain once a malware sample is collected. The first step in determining its true nature is to have it undergo static analysis. Static analysis is the process of extracting data from a file while the file is at rest, or static. From this data, information is formulated to determine whether the file is malicious. Static analysis was successful during the early days of computer viruses, but as malware became complicated and able to apply protective mechanisms such as encryption while the malware is static, static analysis usually comes up short when it comes to determining a file s true behavior and, in the case of malware, the malware s main directive. But this is no reason to discount static analysis altogether. Static analysis can still offer a glimpse, albeit limited, of the suspicious file s nature. So, static analysis is still a useful first step in the process of determining the malware s true directive. The process of static analysis is made possible by different file inspection tools and the system where all these tools are correctly installed and configured. Static analysis is not possible without the right combination of these two. In this chapter, I will focus on the system where static analysis is conducted. I will discuss how to set up a static analysis lab that will host different file inspection tools.",

The Static Analysis Lab The static analysis lab is a computer system used to analyze files at rest. Its main purpose is to host the different file inspection tools needed by malware researchers and analysts to extract all the data possible from a file at rest. A static analysis lab does not need to cater to all the different needs or dependencies of malware or any suspicious files that need to undergo static analysis. Static analysis, after all, is the analysis of files without executing those files. Its main concern is to have all the file inspection tools function as intended by the researchers. An effective and well-configured static analysis lab has the following characteristics: Can host different file inspection tools regardless of the operating system (OS) the tools are written for     Can mitigate possible infection through hardening the system Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 149     Can mitigate the possibility of the lab becoming a staging point by malware and attackers by isolating the lab from any production network     Can go to different online resources anonymously These characteristics are important to consider when setting up a static analysis lab.

    "content": "Host File Inspection Tools A static analysis lab should be able to host different file inspection tools regardless of the OS the tools are written for. This is possible by emulating or virtualizing different operating systems that have useful file inspection tools. In static analysis, there are tools that are on only one operating system but are useful in analyzing files written for another operating system. For example, there are tons of file inspection tools present only in Linux-based operating systems that can be used to analyze Windows files. Also, some scripting languages are easily created and supported in Linux systems that can be used to create scripts to parse a Windows file for the purpose of analysis. Mitigate Possible Infection A static analysis lab must be hardened. This means it must be secured, with the exception of having a real-time malware scanner enabled, so the possibility of becoming infected is minimized. A static analysis lab must be treated as a system with operational value. It must be secured as you would an operations system. And since this system will process suspicious and malware files, the only thing that must be excluded when it comes to hardening or securing the static analysis lab is the presence of any endpoint security that will interfere with the static analysis process. One example is a realtime malware scanner that will quarantine or delete a suspicious or malware file that it detects in the system. NOTE Antivirus scanners are considered file inspection tools and are used in static analysis labs. Some researchers prefer them to be on a separate system, while some do not mind having them in the same static analysis lab as other tools as long as the real-time scanning capability is disabled.",

If there is none, make sure that real-time scanning is disabled, and as an added precaution, set the action to quarantine if a file is detected. Mitigate Becoming a Malware Staging Point This is related to the previous section of mitigating a possible malware infection. But just to be sure that the machine or static analysis lab will not be used as a staging point for malware to infect other systems or conduct an attack, the system must be isolated from any production network. Every machine gets infected. It is just a question of when. Therefore, isolation is key in mitigating the possibility of becoming a malware staging point. NOTE There is a possibility that some free or open source static malware analysis tools can have hidden code in them that can be detrimental to the system and user. Isolating the lab minimizes the risk of any malicious network-related functions that some of these tools might carry. Anonymous Communication A static analysis lab can also be used to conduct research online or download tools or malware samples from different sources. It is always good to have any malware research lab anonymized in case there is a need to do these tasks. It is a precaution to protect the systems from being blocked by attackers or, worse, become a target of their distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack.",

As you know, all computer systems carry the risk of failure one way or another. It is better to be prepared for this scenario so static analysis operation can continue without any significant downtime. Setting Up the Lab You can set up the static analysis lab in either a virtual or bare-metal environment. There s no difference between the two since the malware is at rest. It does not affect the efficacy of the tools unless a tool specifically needs a bare-metal environment, which is unlikely for a static file inspection tool. But regardless of the environment, the steps in setting up a static analysis lab are the same. To set up a static analysis lab, you will be doing the following steps: 1. Choose the hardware. 2.",

Choose the Hardware An often-overlooked process in setting up a malware research lab such as a static analysis lab is choosing the correct hardware. This is an important choice and must be based on the needs of the analyst. For the hardware, there are two choices. Desktop     Laptop Both of these choices have several advantages, but the right choice depends on the analyst. If the analyst wants to set up multiple static lab images that require a lot of storage, memory, and computing power, she might be tempted to choose a more powerful desktop that can expand memory capacity up to 64GB and that can support up to four internal hard drives of 4TB each for her hardware. If she s mobile and travels a lot or is an incident responder who goes to different clients, then a laptop might be the more reasonable choice. Whatever hardware is chosen 152 Part II: Malware Research Lab depends on the needs and circumstances of the analyst. The most important thing is that the hardware has enough space, memory, and computing power to support the static analysis lab and the tools that will be installed. TIP It is always good to have external hard drives available for backup and extra storage and to have universal serial bus (USB) sticks for transferring files and for serving as boot disks in case of failure. In some cases, this is not even a choice. A well-funded malware analyst can have both a desktop and a laptop setup. Install the Operating System Although the concentration is on analyzing Windows-based files here, I will not be limiting the discussion to using Windows-based file inspection tools.",

Install the Operating System Although the concentration is on analyzing Windows-based files here, I will not be limiting the discussion to using Windows-based file inspection tools. There are tools offered by other operating systems such as Linux that will prove valuable in static analysis. With this in mind, I will present two static analysis labs: a Windows-based static analysis lab and a Linux-based static analysis lab. For the Linux one, I will be using Ubuntu. Windows When creating a static analysis lab running on Windows, I always opt for Windows 7 32-bit. The main reason for me choosing 32-bit is to cater to most static analysis or file inspection tools that are widely used today. Take note that this is a personal preference; please feel free to use 64-bit if you desire to do so. Most tools will run there too, and it s just a matter of time that all the tools will run seamlessly in 64-bit. Installing Windows is quite easy and well documented already, so I will not delve into it that much. Instead, I will focus more on solving issues relating to its installation, especially those that are common in installing Windows in a baremetal environment. Some of the issues are the following: A required CD DVD drive device driver is missing  error     Systems shipped without CD DVD drives Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 153  A required CD DVD drive device driver is missing  Error Most researchers use a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscription to download various flavors of Windows ISO images and burn them onto a disc.

This is a common practice. But using this type of installer disc and not the one provided by the computer manufacturer to set up Windows often leads to an error message that pops up during installation. The error message is  A required CD DVD drive device driver is missing. This is easily solved by using the installation discs provided by the manufacturer or invoking the restoration procedure using the OS backup that came pre-loaded on the computer s hard disk. But in most cases, the installation discs are no longer available or accessible, and the hard disk has been reformatted to fit the researcher s need, thus losing whatever restoration files that are there. So, the only choice is to use a Windows installation disc burned from MSDNprovided Windows ISOs. The main reason for the error message appearing during installation is because Windows 7 installation discs do not have all the system drivers for all manufacturers. Windows 7 s generic drivers do not work either. When the disc is inserted and the option to boot using the disc drive is activated, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) spins the drive and checks whether the disc is bootable. If it is, it loads the data from the installation disc. Control is then passed to Windows so it can proceed with the installation.",

Since most of the data Windows needs to continue installation is on the disc, it needs to be able to read the contents of the disc. But then when it tries to control the disc to read data, Windows is not able to do it because it does not have the correct drivers to do it. This is because the BIOS was not able to or does not have the capability to pass the disc driver it used to Windows. As a result, Windows has no interface to control the disc drive, and the error message, A required CD DVD drive device driver is missing  appears. For Windows to have the ability to control the disc drive, the user has to provide the driver. Take note that the driver Windows 7 needs is not the one that comes with or is provided by the disc drive manufacturer but the RAID SATA IDE driver of the motherboard. You can download this driver from the computer manufacturer s website, or you can ask the manufacturer to send you a copy on a disc. The driver files are usually compressed in ZIP or RAR format. Make sure they are decompressed and copy them to the installation disc, a thumb drive, or a separate partition in the hard disk. When Windows 7 asks for the drivers during installation, browse to the folder where the drivers are located, and installation will proceed unless the drivers are wrong. If the drivers are wrong, make sure you find the right one and try again. If everything is OK, you should be good to go.",

Once inside, disable the driver signature enforcement capability, save, and reboot again. This should fix the problem. LAB 7-1: Extracting and Copying Drivers to the Windows 7 Installation Media Some drivers come in an installation package that needs to undergo an installation procedure so the driver files can be extracted. This lab will show how to extract the driver files. What You Need: Installation media     System running Windows 7     Copy of the driver Steps: 1. Download or copy the driver to the system running Windows 7. 2. Double-click the driver installation package to install it in its default location. Figure 7-1 shows an example of installing the driver in its default location of C: DRIVERS WIN AMT. 3. If the driver installer has an option of not installing the driver and just copying it in the default location, you can select not to install it. If there is none, just continue the installation. Figure 7-2 shows a check box that will not install the driver after it has been extracted into the default location. 4. Perform the previous steps for all drivers that are needed during installation. 5. Go to the default location where the drivers are installed and copy them to the installer media or any media that can be accessed during installation. TIP Copying the whole DRIVERS folder is easier and does the trick really well when drivers are needed during installation. Just be mindful of the size.",

However, there is an option to buy an external disc drive, but I find this to be bulky, especially if the aim is to travel with the static analysis lab. In cases like this, I use a thumb drive or a USB stick as the installation medium for Windows 7. To create a thumb drive or a USB Windows 7 installer, you need to do the following: 1. Create a bootable USB stick. 2. Copy the Windows installation file to the USB stick. 3. Copy important drivers and other tools to the USB stick. A bootable thumb drive that has the Windows 7 installation files should be treated similar to a bootable Windows 7 installation disc. Everything else is the same except the media. It is good to have all the drivers copied into the thumb drive. This makes it easy to install the drivers. For me, I always use a Bluetoothconnected mouse rather than the touchpad because of its sensitivity. Having my Bluetooth mouse driver in the thumb drive enables me to use my mouse immediately while going through the rest of the installation. It is also good to have all the tools the analyst needs on the thumb drive.",

You can find the full documentation at https: help. ubuntu. com. For an Ubuntu static analysis lab, I always opt for the version that has long-term support (LTS). As of the book s writing, the latest LTS version is Ubuntu 14. 04. 1 LTS. LTS versions usually come with five years of security and maintenance updates. Ubuntu 14. 04 was released in the summer of 2014, so it gives you until 2019 for updates. You can download Ubuntu from http: www. ubuntu. com download desktop. Installing Ubuntu is simple.

Harden the Lab A static analysis lab is like any computer system. The only difference is its main purpose, which is to analyze static malware or malware at rest. Therefore, to keep it from being compromised and exploited by attackers, it is a must to harden a Figure 7-8 Bootable USB device created successfully. 164 Part II: Malware Research Lab static analysis lab, similar to how typical computer systems are hardened. The only exception is the installation of an endpoint security product, which may result in the quarantine of malware samples that will undergo static analysis. In actual practice, not only is the static analysis lab used to analyze malware, but it is also used to do research about malware and different kinds of threats on the Web. Therefore, it is exposed to the same infection vectors as any other systems are. To effectively harden a static analysis lab, I always follow these steps: 1. Update and patch. 2. Protect the web browser. 3. Restrict access. Update and Patch Hardening the system requires all the essential bug fixes and security patches to be installed. This includes not only the operating system patches but also patches of software installed in the static analysis lab. This ensures that some bugs and vulnerabilities are solved, but you must understand that there will always be bugs or vulnerabilities out there that are known or unknown that are not covered by the latest patches. TIP Create a regular schedule of updating patches. I usually make mine Tuesday evening to coincide with Microsoft s Patch Tuesdays.",

TIP Create a regular schedule of updating patches. I usually make mine Tuesday evening to coincide with Microsoft s Patch Tuesdays. But if you are in a different time zone, you might need to schedule the updating of patches differently. Windows Update takes care of updating Windows. It displays critical and optional updates that the user can choose to install. Sometimes some of these patches will cause the system to crash; if this happens, you can use System Restore to revert to a known good state before installing the patches. Windows Update makes a restore point before the patches are installed, so you should be covered. As for the software installed in the system, there are lots of free vulnerability scanners available that are designed to detect vulnerabilities and weakness in the installed software and redirect the user to a patch, usually located on the software manufacturer s site, if it is available. Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 165 My personal favorite when it comes to vulnerability scanners is Secunia Online Software Inspector (OSI). It s free, and it s online. You can find it at http: secunia. com vulnerability_scanning online. TIP A good place to keep up to date with the latest vulnerabilities is http: cve. mitre. org. The Windows Update equivalent in Ubuntu is the Update Manager, as shown in Figure 7-9. It takes care of updating the operating system and software installed in the system.",

TIP To look for the Update Manager or any other application in Ubuntu, simply click the Dash Home icon in the left corner and enter the name of the application you are looking for in the search bar that will appear. For the command-line purists, Ubuntu offers an update mechanism by simply using the apt-get command-line tool. This command-line tool handles different software packages in Ubuntu and other Linux-based distros. To update using the command line, issue the following commands: sudo apt-get update   sudo apt-get upgrade The apt-get update command syncs the package index files with their sources. These sources are usually reached via the Internet. After everything is synchronized, issuing the apt-get upgrade command starts the installation of the newest versions of all software packages installed on the system. Escalated privilege is needed to accomplish the update, which is the reason for the additional use of sudo in the command line (sudo is short for  superuser do ). Once this command is used, you must input a root or superuser password. Protect the Web Browser Your window to the Web is your Internet browser. When doing online research, the chances of stumbling upon a malicious domain or uniform resource locator (URL) are high, especially if the main goal is collecting more data about a certain malware.

NoScript is a Firefox extension that provides extra protection for Firefox, Seamonkey, and other Mozilla-based browsers. It allows JavaScript, Java, Flash, and other plug-ins to be executed only by trusted websites of the user s choice. NoScript also provides protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. NoScript is free and open source. BetterPrivacy serves to protect against special long-term cookies, a new generation of  supercookie  that silently conquered the Internet. This new cookie generation offers unlimited user tracking to industry and market research. Concerning privacy, Flash cookies are critical. This add-on was made to make users aware of those hidden, never-expiring objects and to offer an easier way to view and manage them since browsers are unable to do that for the user. Flash cookies (local shared objects  LSOs ) are pieces of information placed on the user s computer by a Flash plug-in.

Restrict Access It is always good practice to have the least privilege account running when using a system and give or use escalated or admin privilege only when needed. In the 172 Part II: Malware Research Lab static analysis lab, the main tips when it comes to restricting access include the following: Run under the least privileged account. Give tools admin access only when needed. Run Under the Least Privileged Account Anyone who has experienced or has been compromised with malware knows the importance of having a least privileged account currently logged in when the malware is attempting to infect the system. A least privileged account usually will have no or limited access to resources that the malware needs to successfully compromise a system. Although it is possible that the malware has technology to get around this, it is still important to make life difficult for the malware. And if malware ever became successful in compromising a system with a least privileged account currently logged in, there is less damage because of limited access to vital system resources. Take note that the default account in older versions of Windows such as Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 is the administrator, and it has escalated privileges.",

    "content": "You Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 173 also do not want the cybercriminals to remember the systems you are using as research systems and get blocked or attacked. Therefore, anonymity is important. There are different ways to stay anonymous online. Among them are the following: Proxy servers     Virtual private networks     Online anonymizers     Tor Proxy Servers The most common way to stay anonymous online is through the use of proxy servers. A proxy server, also known as a proxy, is a system that acts as an intermediary between a computer or a local network and the Internet. In other words, it acts as a middleman between the local systems and the Internet. It does this by intercepting all connections from the local systems and having them all come through one port. The proxy then forwards the connections to the Internet or another network through another port. Since there is no direct access between the local systems and the Internet, it is difficult to identify the exact computer making the connection or request. As a result, the attackers won t be able to put tabs on the system or static analysis lab doing the research. NOTE A proxy server not only provides security but also provides increased performance when browsing since it caches frequently visited websites. It is important to keep in mind that communications from the local systems to the proxy server and from the proxy server to the Internet are not encrypted. So if there is data there that can identify the local system behind the proxy server in any way, it is possible that the cover can be blown. TIP The best way to protect communication between the local system to the proxy server and from the proxy server to the Internet is by using HTTP Secure (HTTPS).",

RU http: www. samair. ru proxy      Public Proxy Servers http: www. publicproxyservers. com proxy list1. html These proxy servers are open to anybody. But since they are free, they may suffer from limited or controlled bandwidth; therefore, they may not be as fast or reliable as you want. And there is a high chance that these proxy servers will permanently disappear without notice, so they might be good only for temporary anonymization. This is why it is important to always have a fresh list of publicly available proxy servers. TIP Free proxies carry several privacy risks. Make sure you understand the privacy policy of the free services before using them. Free services often come with a price, and that price has to do with giving up some of your privacy or information. Use these services at your own risk. For those who want a more reliable proxy service that will not disappear without notice, the best way is to subscribe to a paid proxy service. Another alternative, if you have the budget and resource, is to create your own. Virtual Private Networks The communication between the local system and the proxy server is not encrypted.",

Another alternative, if you have the budget and resource, is to create your own. Virtual Private Networks The communication between the local system and the proxy server is not encrypted. Therefore, any data that flows can be intercepted or snooped by prying eyes. One solution for this is to use a virtual private network (VPN). A virtual private network is an extension of a private network across the Internet. Individual users, such as those working remotely or those currently traveling on business, oftentimes use a VPN to get access to network resources in the company as if they are logged in to the company s local area network (LAN). Businesses use this all the time, especially if the remote employees do a lot of business using an unknown or untrusted public network, which is always the case when traveling on business. This is because VPN encrypts all communications that pass through the public network, and more importantly, for your purpose, it can mask the real Internet Protocol (IP) and location of the requesting system. Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 175 The local system s real IP address is 100 percent hidden when using a virtual private network. NOTE A VPN is a good way to secure a computer s Internet session because all the data that is sent and received is encrypted. To use a VPN, the user must install a VPN client. The client initiates the connection to the VPN servers by making sure that the user has valid credentials to access the VPN servers.",

Online Anonymizers In cases wherein the online research is done only occasionally by the researcher or analyst, an online anonymizer or web browsing anonymizer is enough to satisfy what is needed. Online anonymizers are services offered, mostly for free, that let the user hide her real IP address and other information from the website being surfed. In short, the webmasters or the owners of the website being surfed will not have the user s real IP address. LINGO Online anonymizers are also known as web proxies. An online anonymizer is browser based. This means the user just needs to go to the online anonymizer website and input the URL or website she wants to surf, and anonymous surfing commences.

It supports multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. It also supports Android. Tor, as described in its main page, is a network of virtual tunnels allowing people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.

Therefore, it is always wise to have a backup and a streamlined process of how to restore the system in case it fails. This saves time and gets the system running quickly, especially if time is of the essence. Figure 7-14 VirtualBox. Chapter 7: Static Analysis Lab 183 TIP For the purpose of portability and easy restoration in case of failure, I always opt for a virtual environment based static analysis lab. Most researchers, such as myself, always opt for a virtual environment when it comes to static analysis labs. It makes it portable and easy to restore from failure. Plus, the capability of having multiple image snapshots makes it convenient to have different setup configurations. The good thing about static analysis labs is that they do not have the inherent problems of dynamic analysis labs that run in virtualized environments. The malware is at rest during analysis, so even if the malware has a virtualized environment detection capability, it has no effect on the static analysis process being conducted. But if the researcher chooses to set up her static analysis lab in a bare-metal environment, there are lots of tools that can be used to back up and restore the bare-metal system in case of failure. My favorite is Clonezilla, which can be downloaded from http: clonezilla.",

I ll delve into Clonezilla further when I start discussing the dynamic analysis lab. Recap In this chapter, I discussed the static analysis lab. I identified what makes an effective and well-configured lab. The parameters are as follows: Can host different file inspection tools regardless of the OS the tools are written for     Can mitigate possible infection through hardening the system     Can mitigate the possibility of the lab becoming a staging point by malware and attackers by isolating the lab from any production network     Can go to different online resources anonymously I then identified the basic steps in setting up a static analysis lab, which are as follows: Choose the hardware. Install the operating system. Harden the lab. 184 Part II: Malware Research Lab     Anonymize the lab. Isolate the lab. Back up and restore. I tackled how to solve Windows installation problems, especially if the hardware of choice is a laptop with a disc drive but no device driver available or does not come with a disc drive. I discussed how to harden the lab by following the most common steps, which are as follows: Update and patch. Protect the web browser.",

It is analogous to an organism being studied in a small, contained area that mimics its natural habitat. The only difference is that it is a controlled and simulated environment. The controlled environment where dynamic analysis is being conducted that is designed to mimic a malware s target environment is known as the dynamic analysis lab. This is where malware behavior can be observed, monitored, and recorded.

Setting Up the Lab Similar to a static analysis lab, the dynamic analysis lab can be set up in either a virtual or bare-metal environment. But unlike the static analysis lab, where there is no difference whether the environment is virtual or bare-metal, a dynamic analysis lab environment can make or break an analysis session, especially if the malware is virtual-aware. This is why it is important to take into consideration whether a virtualized environment or a bare-metal one will be used in setting up a dynamic analysis lab. LINGO A virtual-aware malware is malware that has the ability to detect whether it is running in a virtualized environment. Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 189 The ideal setup is to have both because both environments offer several advantages that complement each other. The virtualized environment is easy to manage, replicate, back up, and restore. But then again, virtual-aware malware can render a virtual dynamic analysis lab useless. The bare-metal system, on the other hand, solves the problem of virtual-aware malware from evading dynamic analysis. But it is not as easy to manage, replicate, back up, and restore as a virtualized environment. Although there are lots of virtual-aware malware out there, a big chunk of malware that is seen every day in the wild does not possess this evasion technique.",

Therefore, a virtualized environment is still useful. But since there is no initial knowledge of whether the malware being subjected to the virtualized dynamic analysis lab is virtual-aware or not, a good rule of thumb is to have all binary samples processed in a virtualized environment, and then those that do not produce any results will be processed using a bare-metal dynamic analysis lab. TIP Process all samples in a virtualized dynamic analysis lab environment first and use a bare-metal dynamic analysis lab only if the virtualized environment does not yield any results. Regardless of the environment, the steps needed to set up a dynamic analysis lab are basically the same. The only difference is how to execute each step. To set up a dynamic analysis lab, you will be performing the following steps: 1. Choose the hardware. 2. Install the operating system. 3. Make the lab malware friendly. 4. Anonymize the lab. 5. Isolate the lab. Choose the Hardware Like with a static analysis lab, a researcher building a dynamic analysis lab has several choices when it comes to hardware. They are as follows: Desktop     Laptop 190 Part II: Malware Research Lab Both of these choices have several advantages, as discussed in Chapter 7. It boils down to the analyst s needs.

But if the need is more for power, that is, you are hosting a handful of virtualized dynamic analysis lab with different flavors, then the best choice is a powerful desktop or a server. The most important thing when it comes to hardware choice is that it has enough space, memory, and computing power to support the dynamic analysis lab or several dynamic analysis lab images. LINGO A dynamic analysis lab image is another term for virtualized dynamic analysis lab environment. Install the Operating System In the previous chapter when discussing how to set up a static analysis lab, I did not limit the topic to Windows. I also discussed how to set up an Ubuntu system. This is because there are Linux-based file inspection tools that prove valuable in static analysis. But since dynamic analysis is the process of analyzing malware while it is in motion, you do not need any Linux-based dynamic analysis lab because it is not the malware s target OS. Instead, I will concentrate on showing how to set up a Windows system where malware can execute and run as it is intended to run. The focus is on Windows since the scope of the discussion revolves around Windows-based files. When it comes to a Windows dynamic analysis lab, you must have different flavors of Windows available. The following are the most commonly used in dynamic analysis labs today: Windows XP Service Pack 3 32-bit     Windows 7 32-bit     Windows 7 Service Pack 1 32-bit     Windows 7 64-bit     Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit     Windows 8 It is always good to have different flavors of Windows available.",

This makes analysis much more effective and gives the researcher a chance to see how Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 191 a malware behaves in different Windows flavors. For example, if a malware successfully runs in Windows 7 but not in Windows 7 Service Pack 1, this can already be a good indicator that the malware probably is utilizing some vulnerability in Windows 7 that has been solved by Service Pack 1. This information is already useful. A researcher can simply advise affected users to install Service Pack 1 to stop the malware from spreading while more analysis and a better solution is still being worked on. TIP A Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscription is a good way to have access to different flavors of Windows. Get one if you or the company you work for has the budget for this. If there is no budget for an MSDN subscription, buying separate Windows installers might be the cheaper alternative. Since it is always good to have both a virtualized dynamic analysis lab and a bare-metal dynamic analysis lab, you need to familiarize yourself with the basics of installing Windows in these environments. Installing in a Virtualized Environment Lots of virtualized environments can be used when creating a dynamic analysis lab. The most common are the following: VMware     VirtualBox by Oracle     Virtual PC by Microsoft The most popular VMware virtualization software is VMware Workstation for Windows and Fusion for Mac.",

These require licenses. The free version of VMware is VMware Player. It is useful for building virtualized environments, but it does not offer as many features as those offered by the paid versions. VirtualBox and Virtual PC, on the other hand, are all free. For these purposes, I will be concentrating more on VMware Player and VirtualBox. Feel free to experiment with using Virtual PC by Microsoft. Installing the operating system (OS) in a virtualized environment is easy. All that is needed is the ISO image of the OS installer. It is ideal if you have an MSDN subscription because the OS installers are distributed as ISO images. 192 Part II: Malware Research Lab Another important aspect of creating a virtualized dynamic analysis lab is the choice of the host OS. Some researchers prefer a Linux-based OS such as Ubuntu or even Mac, while others prefer Windows. This is up to you and your needs. For me, I always prefer Ubuntu as the host OS and simply install a virtualized Windows environment. To do this, I use either VMware Player or VirtualBox. I prefer this setup as a precaution just in case malware has the capability to compromise the host OS because of a hole or vulnerability in the virtualization software. Having a host OS that the malware is not designed to execute in minimizes the risk of malware infection. By taking away the OS dependency of malware, the risk of malware infection is mitigated. LINGO The host OS is where the virtualization software is installed. The guest OS is the OS that is virtualized by the virtualization software.",

TIP You can save the output from a command line to a file just by typing   filename at the end of the command line. Installing in a Bare-Metal System Installing Windows in a bare-metal system has already been well documented. You have been installing Windows in bare-metal systems since the OS was first released, so there is no need to spend too much time on it in this book. But with new hardware today that comes with no disc drive, you have to be familiar with how to install Windows in these devices, especially if you will not be utilizing the hardware manufacturer s OS restore functionality. TIP To be on the safe side, do not rely on a PC manufacturer s OS restore functionality even if the backup OS is found on a separate partition of the local hard disk because there is always a risk of it being compromised by previously executed (accidentally or on purpose) malware. It is always good to have a separate OS installer or image backup that is separated from the dynamic analysis lab to ensure that the image or the installer is not compromised. A good way to install the OS is by using a universal serial bus (USB) stick. In the previous chapter, I discussed how to create a bootable USB Windows installer. Follow the instructions in Chapter 7, and you will be all set. If the hardware comes with a disc drive but the device driver is not available anymore, you will see an error message stating that a required CD DVD device driver was not found during installation.",

This is to ensure that the effects of malware infection are minimized. But in a dynamic analysis lab, your main goal is the opposite. You want the malware to execute. You want to provide it with everything it needs to execute properly. Because if it executes as it is intended to do, you will have the chance to capture its behavior and understand its main directive. Therefore, you must have a dynamic analysis lab that is malware friendly. To make a dynamic analysis lab malware friendly, you need to do the following: 1. Make the OS malware friendly. 2.",

Now, there are lots of software that falls into this category, but for the purpose of brevity, I will concentrate on three often abused by attackers, listed here: Microsoft Office     Adobe Flash Player     Adobe Reader Microsoft Office is included not only because of its macro capabilities but also because it is widely used in homes, schools, and businesses. Although there Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 209 is not that much macro malware around, it is still good to have Office installed, especially if you are going to create enticing Office files. Having enticing files in Microsoft Office format but no Office installed might make attackers suspicious. A malware can always have a built-in functionality to detect programs installed in a system. A malware may refuse to steal any documents if the appropriate program for it does not exist in the system, especially if it is targeting a user or non-server system. This is one precaution malware writers take to beat honeypots with enticing files. TIP If you are going to use bait files for information stealers, make sure that the appropriate program for those files are installed. For example, Excel worksheets and Word documents must have Office Windows installed on the system.",

Creating enticing files with 0 bytes defeats the whole purpose of having enticing files. Remember that a malware can have checking mechanisms to know whether a file is valid. Create and Utilize Dummy Social Media Accounts Some malware has special needs such as having a Facebook or Twitter account in the compromised machine for it to function. Therefore, it is always good to have personas in your dynamic analysis lab. Having these dummy accounts ready is always helpful, so if you are faced with a malware that requires this, you can simply open a browser and log in to the social network of choice and then let the malware execute. 214 Part II: Malware Research Lab TIP Configure the browsers to remember your social media account so you don t need to input the password over and over again.

This is also advantageous if the dynamic analysis lab will be part of an automated malware analysis infrastructure. Anonymize the Lab A dynamic analysis lab is an active computer environment. Depending on the malware running on the lab, the dynamic analysis lab may need to have an Internet connection to facilitate the malware communicating to its command and control, or C2. LINGO C2, C C, and CnC are all abbreviations of a botnet s command and control. Therefore, it is important to anonymize the dynamic analysis lab. This protects the dynamic analysis lab from being tagged by the cybercriminals as research labs so the dynamic analysis systems won t get blocked or attacked. To anonymize the dynamic analysis lab, you will be using the following: Proxy servers     Virtual private network     Tor It is one less than the anonymization technologies I discussed in the previous chapter. The one I took out is the online anonymizer. You do not need this since you will not be actively surfing the Internet, and the other three should take care of the anonymization you need in case the malware needs to utilize the browser. Chapter 7 discusses all these technologies. Isolate the Lab Dynamic analysis labs need to be isolated even more than static analysis labs do. Malware is executed in a dynamic analysis lab; therefore, there is real risk that the malware can and will infect systems connected to it.

This is why it is of paramount importance to isolate the dynamic analysis lab from any network. Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 215 A good rule of thumb for isolating a dynamic analysis lab is to have it totally isolated from any form of production network. It cannot be part of any network, and it cannot share any Internet connection with any device. Restoring to a Clean State Every time a malware is processed, the dynamic analysis lab has to be restored to its original clean state after the analysis process. This ensures that the result of the next dynamic malware analysis is not adulterated by the previous one. Restoration time is an important characteristic of a dynamic analysis lab. The faster the restoration time, the more malware that can be analyzed dynamically. Restoration time becomes a big factor, especially if the dynamic analysis lab is part of an automated malware analysis system. Obviously, a virtualized dynamic analysis lab environment has faster restoration time compared to a bare-metal system. Virtualized Environment Clean State Restoration In a virtualized environment, a researcher can have different image snapshots. Image snapshots capture the current state of a virtual machine when the snapshot was taken. With virtual image snapshots, the researcher and analyst can always revert to an image that she wants to work on. This is great for malware analysis. But if the desire is automated dynamic malware analysis, setting an image to be non-persistent is the best option because it does not involve any manual step. The moment the virtual image is restarted, it automatically reverts to its clean state.",

Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 217 Bare-Metal Environment Clean State Restoration In the old days of bare-metal system malware analysis, there is no such thing as a non-persistent image. To go back to a clean state, the bare-metal system had to restored. Restoration had to be done all the time from a backup or clean image. This takes a lot of time, usually between 5 to 15 minutes depending on how fast the input output (I O) of the system is. Plus, everything is done manually. The most popular tool for a restoring bare-metal system during those days was Norton Ghost. Today, Clonezilla is the most popular and easy-to-use bare-metal system backup and restoration tool. I will discuss Clonezilla in greater detail later in this chapter. Fortunately, there is a tool that enables non-persistency in a bare-metal system. This means that every time the bare-metal system is restarted or rebooted, it reverts to a clean state without the need for restoration from a backup image. This significantly lessens the time of the dynamic analysis lab s readiness to tackle another malware. The tool is called Deep Freeze by Faronics. This is not a free tool, but in my humble opinion it is worth the money. You can find more information about this tool at http: www.",

Backing Up and Restoring After investing time and effort in creating a dynamic analysis lab, the next step is to back everything up. Nobody wants to go through the process of building the lab again from scratch if things go haywire. Plus, it is always important to back up critical part of your research systems, which includes the dynamic analysis lab. If it ever fails or behaves abnormally because of a new malware, you can easily restore it and be up and running in no time using its backup. When it comes to backing up the dynamic analysis lab, the following items are important: The golden image     Host OS     Other systems supporting the lab The Golden Image The golden image is the clean image on which all dynamic analysis labs are based. This image is the one that is used by the system to restore the dynamic analysis lab to its clean state. Chapter 8: Dynamic Analysis Lab 219 In a virtualized environment, this is the snapshot or main image of the virtualized dynamic analysis lab. This is easy to back up because a copy of the virtual machine can just be kept offline and serve as the backup.",

This is easy to back up because a copy of the virtual machine can just be kept offline and serve as the backup. TIP When setting up a virtual machine image, specifically in VMware, choose to have the image files divided into 2GB chunks. This makes it easy to copy and back up. In a bare-metal environment, backing it up as an image is easy too. The tool I use is Clonezilla, which can be downloaded from http: clonezilla. org downloads. php. As mentioned in the previous chapter, it is free and easy to use. The number of golden images you have depends on the Windows flavor you have plus the different configurations and settings you have for each flavor. For example, if you have the different flavors covered here, then you will have at least six golden images: Windows XP Service Pack 3 32-bit     Windows 7 32-bit     Windows 7 Service Pack 1 32-bit     Windows 7 64-bit     Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit     Windows 8 If for each of the images you have different variations, such as one image has Adobe installed while the other one does not, then that s an additional six golden images, making your total twelve.

Host OS Aside from backing up the golden images of a virtualized dynamic analysis lab, it is also important to back up the host OS.",

This ensures that if the host OS fails, there is no need to restore it from scratch and reconfigure it again to support the virtualized dynamic analysis lab. Sometimes the process of backing up the host 220 Part II: Malware Research Lab OS is the most effective way to back up the whole dynamic analysis infrastructure because the backup also contains the golden images already. As a result, the system can resume its normal function after restoration, and there is no need to restore the golden images from their separate backups. The only thing that needs to be considered here is the space that will be taken up by backing up the host OS with the golden images. Other Systems Supporting the Lab Some dynamic analysis labs have other systems supporting them. For example, an interconnected multiple dynamic analysis lab might have a Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) server, its own private DNS server, a spoofed Internet box, and so on. These systems will also need backing up so they can easily be up and running in case of failure. My tool of choice when it comes to backing up and restoring golden images of bare-metal dynamic analysis labs, the host operating system, and other systems supporting the lab is Clonezilla. It is free and easy to use.",

This is the process where you actually dissect the malware sample and find out what it is capable of doing. But as with any inspection or analysis exercise, a process has to be followed to get the most out of the activity. And in a malware inspection activity (more popularly known as a malware analysis activity), there are steps that needed to be followed to effectively analyze malware. Going back to the malware analysis process discussed in Chapter 1, the malware goes through multiple steps of analysis to get to the bottom of its malicious directive, as shown in Figure 9-1. But before analysis should begin, an understanding of the file format of the malware is important. Since this book covers Windows files, I will be concentrating on the Windows file format known as Portable Executable (PE). In this chapter, I will discuss what the PE file format is, how it is structured, and what tools you can use to make sense of the data that you can extract from this format that will aid you in your investigation of malicious activity.

It is called Portable Executable because Microsoft s vision was to use the same file format in future flavors of Windows, making the PE file common to all Windows platforms regardless of what central processing unit (CPU) they support. In my humble opinion, this idea has been accomplished because the descendants of Windows NT and Windows 95 still use the same Windows PE file. The two most common file extensions of PE files are. EXE and. DLL, which I will refer to from now on as EXE and DLL files, respectively. An EXE is an executable file, whereas a DLL is a dynamic link library file. An executable file is pretty self-explanatory. A dynamic link library (DLL) file, as defined by Microsoft, is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time. The main advantage of using DLLs is to promote code reuse and efficient memory usage. Instead of a program having to load the common functionality it needs on a separate memory space every time as a consequence of that functionality being coded into the program itself, the program can simply use the same functionality that is contained in and imported by the DLL. The program saves on memory usage, and the functionality it needs does not need to be coded into the program itself.",

    "content": "The program saves on memory usage, and the functionality it needs does not need to be coded into the program itself. Microsoft, as published in its knowledge base, summarizes the advantages offered by a DLL as follows: Uses fewer resources When multiple programs use the same library of functions, a DLL can reduce the duplication of code that is loaded on the disk and in physical memory. This can greatly influence the performance of not just the program that is running in the foreground but also other programs that are running on the Windows operating system. Promotes modular architecture A DLL helps promote developing modular programs. This helps you develop large programs that require multiple language versions or a program that requires modular architecture. An example of a modular program is an accounting program that has many modules that can be dynamically loaded at run time. Eases deployment and installation When a function within a DLL needs an update or a fix, the deployment or installation of DLL does not require the program to be relinked with the DLL. Additionally, if multiple programs use the same DLL, they will all benefit from the update or the fix. This issue may more frequently occur when you use a third-party DLL that is regularly updated or fixed. 234 Part III: Malware Inspection TIP It is important to understand the modular advantage of DLLs because most malware today uses modular architecture, especially malware that updates itself with new functionality in a short period of time. Even though it seems that there is huge difference in terms of file format between an EXE and a DLL, because of how DLL files are used, when you look closely, the difference is as simple as the difference in their extensions. Dissecting the two files will reveal that the only difference they have is a bit in one field of the PE header that tells Windows whether the file can be treated as an EXE or a DLL. What a PE header is will be discussed in the next section.",

This bit is powerful because as long as it is set to characterize the file as a DLL, it will be treated as a DLL regardless of its extension. As a matter of fact, the following file extensions are implemented as DLLs: OCX files ActiveX control files     CPL files Control Panel files     DRV files Device driver files In your quest to analyze malware, it is important to know all DLL dependencies the malware needs to function properly. If one of the DLLs that a malware needs is not present in your dynamic analysis lab, the analysis will fail because the malware will not run as intended by the attacker. There will be instances wherein you need to install uncommon DLLs into your dynamic analysis lab to successfully run a malware or a suspected malware file. A useful tool for this purpose of determining the DLL dependencies of a PE file is Dependency Walker. Dependency Walker is a free utility that scans any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module (such as EXE, DLL, OCX, or SYS) and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all the dependent modules.

The PE File Format The Windows PE file format is derived from the Common Object File Format (COFF) that was used in Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) systems running the Virtual Memory System (VMS) operating system produced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which was acquired by Compaq in 1998 and merged with HP in 2002. Most of the original Windows NT development team came from DEC, and when coming up with the PE format, they used existing code that they were already familiar with. To get a better feel of the PE format, take a look at a general view of its structure, as shown in Figure 9-3. The PE file format consists of the following: DOS MZ header     DOS stub     PE header     Section table     Sections DOS MZ Header All PE files start with the DOS MZ header. It is located at offset 0 of a PE file. It was put there just in case the program is executed in a system running Disk Operating System (DOS). When the PE format was still being developed, most 236 Part III: Malware Inspection systems were still running DOS.",

When the PE format was still being developed, most 236 Part III: Malware Inspection systems were still running DOS. So, the developers recognized that there was a possibility that an executable designed to run in the new Windows environment would be executed in a DOS environment. The DOS MZ header was placed there to enable a DOS operating system to recognize the PE file as a valid executable file so it can execute the DOS stub, which is discussed in the next section. Figure 9-4 shows an example of a DOS MZ header. The hex values 4Dh and 5Ah represent MZ, which is the initial of Mark Zbikowski, who is the one of the original architects of the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).

The location of the PE header can be found in offset 0x3C relative to the start of the file. The 4-byte value starting at address 0x3C represents the address of the PE header relative to the start of the file. So, looking at Figure 9-4, which shows the DOS MZ header of Calc. EXE, you can determine that the address of the PE header is at 0xF0 because the 4 bytes starting from 0x3C are F0h 00h 00h 00h. Take note that x86 processors use little-endian architecture, so data is actually read from right to left. This means that the least significant byte is stored in the smallest address. In the previous example, the least significant byte is F0h, located in address 0x3C. The next significant byte is 00h, 00h, and 00h, located respectively in 0x3D, 0x3E, and 0x3F.

Figure 9-6 shows the start of the PE header at location 0xF0. The start of the PE header is PE 0 0 or the hex values 50h 45h 00h 00h. This is called the PE signature and, as stated previously, indicates the start of the PE header. When a PE file is executed, the PE loader goes directly to the PE header. The PE loader bypasses the DOS MZ header and DOS stub and proceeds directly to the Figure 9-5 DOS stub of Calc. EXE. Figure 9-6 PE header of Calc. EXE.

Although the name says it s optional, there is nothing optional about this substructure. As stated by Microsoft, this portion of the PE file certainly isn t optional. The COFF format allows individual implementations to define a structure of additional information beyond the standard IMAGE_FILE_HEADER. The fields in the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER are what the PE designers felt was critical information beyond the basic information in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER. Table 9-2 shows the fields of the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER. Take note that the offsets in the table are relative to the start of the PE header.

Section Table As shown in Figure 9-3, the section table is located between the PE header and the PE file s sections. The section table contains information about the sections immediately following it in the PE structure. Think of a section table like a phone book. Each entry in the phone book contains information about a person. The more people who are listed, the thicker the phone book is. The number of entries in the section table depends on the number of sections contained in the image file. But unlike a phone book that contains hundreds of thousands of entries, a section table usually has only five. The number of entries (or sections, for that matter) is defined in the NumberOfSections field in the PE header. Chapter 9: The Portable Executable File 249 The section table is also referred to as the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER. Table 9-4 contains the fields of this structure. Take note that the offset is relative to the start of each entry. Offset Size Field Description Possible Values 0x00 QWORD Name The name of the section. It is an 8-byte, null-padded UTF-8 string. There is no terminating null character if the string is exactly 8 characters. . text. data 0x08 DWORD Misc A union of the file s PhysicalAddress and the VirtualSize of the section. The VirtualSize is the total size of the section when loaded into memory, in bytes. If this value is greater than the SizeOfRawData entry, the section is filled with zeroes. This field is used only by executables. 0x0C DWORD VirtualAddress The address of the first byte of the section when loaded into memory, relative to the image base. 0x10 DWORD SizeOfRawData The size of the initialized data on disk, in bytes.",

Table 9-4 IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER Entries 250 Part III: Malware Inspection It is important to note that the section names have only eight characters reserved for them.

An image that has more than eight characters for a section name is anything but an executable file. Executable files only support section names up to eight characters, and they do not use a string table. The last field in the section table defines the image characteristics.

Together they represent the real content of the PE file. Sections, in general, are simply blocks of data, which can have certain attributes as described in the section table. A section can be code, data, or a combination of both. The main thing they have in common is their attributes. As discussed previously, each section has a unique name. The name is there to describe what the section is. For example, a section named CODE can represent the code section, while a section named. rdata can represent a read-only data section. As a default setting, Borland linker uses section names such as CODE and DATA, while Microsoft prefixes sections with a period, such as. text and. rdata. It is important to remember that the PE loader and Windows itself does not care what the section is called. The names are there for us humans. A developer is free to name the sections of her programs as she sees fit as long as it does not go over the eight-character limit.

The. reloc section contains a table of base relocations. As Microsoft puts it, a base relocation is an adjustment to an instruction or initialized variable value that s needed if the PE loader could not load the file where the linker assumed it would. If the PE loader is able to load the image at the linker s preferred base address, the PE loader completely ignores the relocation information in the. reloc section. The. tls section contains data that was defined using the compiler directive _ _declspec(thread). The. tls section got its name from TLS, the acronym of thread local storage. When it comes to dealing with the. tls section, Microsoft explains it best: The. tls section is related to the TlsAlloc family of Win32 functions. When dealing with a. tls section, the memory manager sets up the page tables so that whenever a process switches threads, a new set of physical memory pages is mapped to the. tls section s address space. This permits perthread local variables. In most cases, it is much easier to use this mechanism than to allocate memory on a per-thread basis and store its pointer in a TlsAlloc ed slot. There s one unfortunate note that must be added about the. tls section and _ _declspec(thread) variables.

    "content": "So, what is a relative virtual address? To understand what it is, you need to know first what a virtual address (VA) space is. As defined by Microsoft, a virtual address space is a set of virtual memory addresses that a process can use. A virtual address does not represent the actual physical location of an object in memory. Instead, the system maintains a page table for each process, which is an internal data structure used to translate virtual address into their corresponding physical addresses. Each time a thread references an address, the system translates the virtual address to a physical address. NOTE The virtual address space for 32-bit Windows is 4GB, while for 64-bit Windows, the default is 8TB. The relative virtual address is simply a distance from a reference point in the virtual address space. A similar concept is a file offset. The file offset describes the location of something relative to the start of the file, while the relative virtual address describes the location of something relative to a point in the virtual address space. To illustrate further, let s take a PE file that usually loads at 0x400000 virtual address, 260 Part III: Malware Inspection and let s say that the start of the PE file s. text or code section is at 0x401000. From this, the RVA of the code section is 0x1000 because that is where it is relative to the loading location of the file in the virtual address space. The formula for this is simply as follows: RVA   Target Address   Load Address RVA   0x401000   0x400000 RVA   0x1000 To convert the RVA to the actual address, which is the target address, simply reverse the process by adding the load address to the RVA.",

PE Import Functions Previously, I discussed that the. idata section contains function and data information that the program imports from other dynamic link libraries. The. idata section is also referred to as the import table of the executable image. This table contains all the information that the PE loader needs to determine the addresses of the functions that the executable image is importing so it can be patched into the executable image. These functions are called import functions because they are the ones being  imported  by the executable. Therefore, import functions are functions that do not reside in the caller s module or program but are called by the caller from another module or program such as a DLL. The caller module only contains information about the functions it is calling from another module, which can be one or more DLLs. The information includes the function names and the names of the dynamic link libraries from which they are imported. This information can be found in the import table.

Take note Chapter 9: The Portable Executable File 261 that there is no field indicating how many IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORs are in an executable image s. idata section. The only way to determine this is to count the number of IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTORs there are and stopping count only when an IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR with null field values is encountered. This signals the last element of the IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR array. Table 9-6 shows the IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR structure.

DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT. symbols: AttributeError: PE instance has no attribute 'DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ EXPORT' When it comes to exporting functions, there is one feature that PE files can do, which is export forwarding. Export forwarding is a feature of export functions that has the ability to forward and export to another DLL. Let s look at an example published by Microsoft regarding export forwarding. In Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP, the KERNEL32 HeapAlloc function is forwarded to the RtlAllocHeap function exported by NTDLL. Forwarding is performed at link time by a special syntax in the EXPORTS section 266 Part III: Malware Inspection of the. DEF file. Using HeapAlloc as an example, KERNEL32 s DEF file would contain the following: EXPORTS   HeapAlloc   NTDLL. RtlAllocHeap How can you tell whether a function is forwarded rather than exposed normally? It is somewhat tricky. Normally, the EAT contains the RVA of the exported symbol. However, if the function s RVA is inside the exports section, as given by the VirtualAddress and Size fields in the DataDirectory, the symbol is forwarded. When a symbol is forwarded, its RVA obviously can t be a code or data address in the current module. Instead, the RVA points to an ASCII string of the DLL and symbol name to which it is forwarded.

You were able to discover the different characteristics of the PE file and what makes it tick. With this newfound basic knowledge of PE files, you are now better equipped to understand Windows malware. When it comes to malware inspection, you always start with an unknown file. You have no idea, at first, whether the file is malicious. Therefore, it is important to handle the file with great care to avoid any unwanted incidents that might lead to a malware outbreak. In this chapter, I will discuss how to properly handle unknown files. You will look at the file s analysis life cycle, from transport to storage, and how to handle files in the right way to prevent anything from unauthorized access to compromise of the files. I will also discuss how to properly store files that are found to be malicious or verified to be malware. File s Analysis Life Cycle A file for analysis actually undergoes three stages. They are the following: Transfer     Analysis     Storage I call this the file s analysis life cycle. The file will get transferred or transported from one location to another. When it reaches its destination, it undergoes analysis. It is during this stage that it is determined whether the file is malicious. After the determination has been done, the file is stored for archival and future research purposes. Throughout the analysis life cycle of the file, it is imperative that it is handled properly to avoid any unwanted incidents.",

Throughout the analysis life cycle of the file, it is imperative that it is handled properly to avoid any unwanted incidents. TIP Always handle unknown files for analysis as if they are malicious. It is better to err on the side of caution. Chapter 10: The Proper Way to Handle Files 271 Transfer Files that need to be analyzed will usually come from an external source. If this is the case, you need to practice great care when moving the file from the source to the analysis machines. You have to consider the following: The file must not be in an executable state. The file must not be accessible to unauthorized users. The source of the file must be verifiable. Non-executable State When a file is transferred, it is important that it is not in an executable state. For Windows executable files, it is easy to make an executable file not in an executable state or, in short, non-executable. You can simply rename the file s extension. For example, you can rename an. EXE file as. EX_, . EX1, or. EXE. XXX. The main idea here is that you change the original extension to a non-executable extension but won t forget what the original extension was. Inaccessible to Unauthorized Users The second thing to consider is access to the file. The file can be transferred via physical means such as a universal serial bus (USB) stick, a hard disk, or any physical storage device. Or it can be transferred automatically via e-mail, direct file transfer, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or download site.",

The file can be transferred via physical means such as a universal serial bus (USB) stick, a hard disk, or any physical storage device. Or it can be transferred automatically via e-mail, direct file transfer, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or download site. These different means of transfer always carry the risk of unauthorized access. Therefore, precautions have to be taken. Unauthorized users must not be able to get hold of the file to be analyzed. Unauthorized access must not occur, especially if the file is of confidential nature. The following are the common practices in the industry when it comes to protecting a file to be analyzed from unauthorized access: Password-protected compressed file     Public-key cryptography Password-protected compressed files are the most common way of ensuring a file can be transferred while protecting it from unauthorized users. Only those who know the password can decompress and access the file. But of course, this is not a good way of protecting the file from unauthorized access because there are tools that can decompress password-protected compressed files even without 272 Part III: Malware Inspection knowledge of the password. In actual practice, password-protected compressed files became popular for the transportation of files because they can bypass e-mail security products. Instead of the file being stripped from the e-mail and deleted, it will simply go through and let the recipient get access to the file. That was the main reason why this method became popular.",

After successful installation, the system can now support 7zip files or files with the. 7Z extension. Chapter 10: The Proper Way to Handle Files 273 3. To compress a file, right-click it and click Compress on the context menu. In this example, I will be using calc. EXE, but please feel free to use any file available. 4. Once the Compress window opens, set the filename extension to. 7z and rename the archive file as you want. The default name of the archive file is usually the original filename of the file being compressed. In this example, I will rename the archive to calc-compress. 5.

Another way to decompress an archive is to simply double-click it. 11. All decompressed files will be in the current folder where the archive file is. The best way to really protect files from unauthorized access is to use public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, requires two unique and separate keys: the private and the public key. Although unique, the two cryptographic keys are related mathematically. As its name suggests, the public key is available publicly. Anyone can have access to it. The private key, on the other hand, is secret and confidential. Only the owner must have access to it. To keep the file confidential or free from unauthorized access, the public key is used to encrypt the file, and then the private key, which is in the possession of the owner, is the only key that can decrypt it.",

TIP It is always good practice to still compress the file to be analyzed and protect it with a password before encrypting it with a public key. In Ubuntu, the most common tool used for creating and managing key pairs is GnuPG or gpg. It uses OpenPGP as its encryption standard. OpenPGP, as stated in http: www. openpgp. org, is a non-proprietary encryption protocol using public key cryptography. It is based on PGP as originally developed by Phil Zimmermann. The OpenPGP protocol defines standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys. Figure 10-2 Password dialog box.

So if you are paranoid and want to make sure that the file did came from the person it is supposed to, private key signing is the answer. LINGO Private key signing means encrypting something using a private key. It can be decrypted using the public key of the signer. In the previous section, I discussed what private and public keys are and how the public key is used to encrypt the file so that only the private key of the recipient can be used to decrypt the file. In this section, it is more about verifying the source. So, the process is reversed. The sender or source signs or encrypts the file using his private key, and it can be decrypted only using the signer s public key. Private key signing ensures that the file came from the real source it is supposed to come from. This ensures the integrity of the file. Since the file can be decrypted by the signer s public key, this means anybody who has access to the public key can have access to the file. This is the reason why the process of signing is done on top of encrypting the file using the public key of the receiver. Anybody, including the intended receiver, can verify the source of the file, but only the receiver, using his private key, can decrypt the file after verifying the source.",

LAB 10-11: Signing a File In this lab, you will be signing a file using your private key so the intended recipient can verify that the file indeed came from a trusted source, which is you. What You Need: System running Ubuntu 14. 04. 1     Generated keys Chapter 10: The Proper Way to Handle Files 289 Steps: 1. Open a terminal window and enter the following command. In this example, you will be signing calc. EXE. gpg --output calc. exe. sig --sign calc. exe 2. The system will ask for a passphrase to unlock your secret key. After supplying the password, the file will be signed. NOTE For added security, the file for signing is compressed and then signed. 3. The signed file is calc. exe. sig. 4. To verify the signature, enter the following command: gpg --verify calc. exe. sig 5. If the signature is good, you will see something like this: gpg: Signature made Mon 08 Dec 2014 02: 02: 19 PM EST using RSA key ID BB7BCC97 gpg: Good signature from \"Christopher Elisan (Lab for Book)  my email \" Primary key fingerprint: BBAD 61F3  6. To decrypt the file, issue the following command: gpg --output calc. exe --decrypt calc. exe. sig 7. During the decryption, gpg will display the key of the signer similar to what was displayed when the private key of the sender was verified.",

As previously mentioned, unknown files must be treated like they are malware. It is better to be safe than sorry. Now you have an idea of how to do the following: Compress and password protect a file     Encrypt using a public key of the intended recipient     Sign using your private key so the source can be verified It is a good idea to combine these three before transferring or transporting a file. Analysis After an unknown file has been transferred from the verified source, the next step is to analyze it. The analysis can be done manually or through an automated system. As I discussed in previous chapters, static analysis requires the file to be static, or at rest. This means you do not need to execute the file to get the information you need when conducting static malware inspection. Since this is the requirement, you do not need to do anything with the file after it is decrypted and decompressed.",

Since this is the requirement, you do not need to do anything with the file after it is decrypted and decompressed. There is no need to revert the file into an executable state. The only time a file is needed to be in an executable state is during dynamic analysis, which I will discuss in future chapters. Therefore, when it comes to handling a file during analysis, it stays in its nonexecutable state. This is the same state the file was in when being transferred from source to destination. The only action needed is to decrypt and decompress it. Any form of analysis, except for dynamic analysis, must always handle the file in a non-executable state. Storage Analysis answers the question, Is the file malicious? Some research organizations discard the files that are benign and keep only those that are deemed malicious. In this section, I will concentrate more on storing files that are deemed malicious or verified to be malware, including the metadata of the files. NOTE Some research organizations keep the files found to be benign for whitelisting purposes. Chapter 10: The Proper Way to Handle Files 291 Storing files deemed malicious follows almost the same concept as when a file is being transferred. This means that when a file is stored, it must be in a nonexecutable state and must be inaccessible to unauthorized users.

Some may comment that this is going overboard, but when it comes to malware, in my humble opinion, there is no going overboard, especially if it has something to do with preventing any sample leaks. You do not want these files or information about these files to fall into the wrong hands (especially the files because they either can be used in their original form or can be modified to be much more resilient in an attack campaign).

I touched on this already in the previous section by using password-protected compressed files and public key cryptography. In most cases, and as widely practiced, the state of malware when it is transferred is the same as how it is stored, which means it undergoes compression and encryption. When a file for 292 Part III: Malware Inspection analysis is received and then proven to be malware after analysis, it undergoes the following: Converted into a non-executable state     Compressed and password protected     Encrypted When it comes to compressing with password protection, some malware research group or companies have their own password that is different from the ones commonly used such as infected, virus, and novirus. As an added precaution, the password-protected compressed file is encrypted. It can be encrypted using public key cryptography, and only the private keys of the authorized users or researchers can decrypt it. Or the drive or data storage where the files reside is encrypted, and the only ones who can decrypt the data storage are those who have knowledge of and access to the needed credentials or tokens.

Static data can be corrupted if the hardware or storage device starts to malfunction or starts deteriorating, causing bad sectors that can result in some data being lost. Sadly, disks today can be corrupted without being detected. This is because of the complexity of disk technology that has multiple points of failure such as a faulty disk controller that can cause data not to be written where it is supposed to be written on disk causing corrupt data.

Buggy and poorly designed software can cause data modification without the knowledge of the user or the system. Data that is transmitted, or dynamic data, is also susceptible to corruption, especially if it is being transmitted through unreliable networks. Unreliable networks usually corrupt data that pass through them because of intermittent connection losses. Without any error checking, the data that is transferred from the source might be different once it reaches the receiver. User error also plays a role in violating data integrity. Using a tool or software in an incorrect manner while dealing with data can corrupt the data. A user can also inadvertently destroy or delete data without knowing it, especially if the user is not well trained to handle that sort of data. Aside from system and user error, there is a more sinister cause that can contribute to data integrity violation, which is malicious intent. Malicious intent to destroy or violate the integrity of data must be considered at all times. It can be carried out through the use of malware or unauthorized breach by an attacker or group of attackers.

The main idea here is to have multiple copies of the data and then have regular integrity checks comparing the copies. If one copy is different, then that is flagged as corrupt data and corrected by overwriting it with the right copy. Although this is the simplest way and the easiest to implement, it is not scalable. It is inefficient as data grows. The storage needs multiply depending on how many copies there are, and the time needed to do integrity checking between the copies can become very long. LINGO Data replication is also known as mirroring. Parity computations are used in RAID drive arrays, such RAID-3, RAID-4, and RAID-5, for fault tolerance and validating data written to the RAID array by calculating the data in two drives and storing the resulting calculation on a third one. The Exclusive OR (XOR) logical operator is used to calculate parity across the RAID array. The main idea here is that if one drive fails, it can be replaced, and the data can be rebuilt from the other two drives. NOTE RAID drives have a  hot-swappable  drive on standby to replace a failed or corrupted drive. Getting the checksum of the data (in this case, the malware samples) and storing it in one place is another method of integrity checking. This is a well-known method.",

It actually reminds me of Microsoft Anti-Virus (MSAV) during the DOS days. The main idea here is to get the checksum of the data and then using it to check whether that data changed. Checksums can be as simple as a hash. Availability Availability ensures that the data is accessible or available when needed. The ideal is no downtime. But since we do not live in an ideal world, there will be downtime. The main idea is to have as little downtime as technically possible. This can be achieved by having the system, both hardware and software, working in tip-top shape. A good way to ensure this is periodic and proper maintenance of the systems where the data is hosted. And if something fails, there has to be immediate response in repairing or replacing the failed component. The most common way to achieve availability is through redundancy. This ensures that if one site is down, the other sites can take over, and the availability Chapter 10: The Proper Way to Handle Files 295 of data is not affected in any way.

Now that you have an understanding of these concepts and an increased awareness of the dangers and pitfalls that you might face if you do not follow them, you are now ready to analyze malware. In this chapter, I will discuss how to inspect static malware, a process also known as static malware analysis or simply static analysis. I will go through the step-by-step process of analyzing static malware and the tools needed to accomplish your goal of extracting information from static malware. Static Analysis Techniques Malware analysis must answer the question of whether a file is malicious. And if it is malicious, what is the malicious file s main directive? In static analysis, you might not get as far as figuring out the malicious file s main directive, but it is an important first step in malware analysis nonetheless. In static analysis, your main goal is to gather as much data and information as possible to aid you in determining the malware s true nature and, if this is not possible, aid in a more effective and efficient way in dynamic analysis. Since you are going to find out whether a file is malicious, you always start with the assumption that the file is unknown. You will also assume that any unknown file that is analyzed is malicious until proven benign. It is better to err on the side of caution. To conduct an effective static analysis, you will be following some basic steps and techniques.",

The steps or techniques identified are to serve as a guide and not a checklist. ID Assignment The first thing you must do is to assign a unique identifier to the file. A common practice in the industry is to use a hash to identify a file uniquely. MD5 and SHA-1 are the most commonly used hashes. SHA-2 is another alternative that makes for minimal hash collision and better resistance from pre-image attack breaks. It includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512 224, and SHA-512 256. LINGO Hash collisions are when two different inputs produce the same hash. A pre-image attack, on the other hand, is finding the original input from its hash value. There are lots of available tools to do this, including the following two: MD5SUM http: www. etree. org md5com. html     Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier http: www. microsoft. com  en-us download details. aspx? id 11533 Besides using these tools, you can create a script using hash libraries included in programming or scripting languages, such as Python.

This process also helps in determining the possible family of the malware. Take note that I am not talking in absolutes here because there is always the possibility of a false positive and misnaming of malware detection. In the analysis process, you use antivirus detection simply as an indicator to help you identify the maliciousness of a file and its possible malware family group. There are two ways to subject a file to an antivirus scan. They are as follows: On-premise antivirus scanning     Online antivirus scanning On-premise antivirus scanning means you have the antivirus product installed in a system you control. It can be a set of different virtualized machines hosting different antivirus products each or an offline tool that utilizes different antivirus product engines to scan a file for possible infection. In an on-premise setup, the management of the system, such as updating scan signatures and ensuring uptime, is your responsibility. So, aside from hardware and software license cost, there is also maintenance cost. One thing that is important to remember is that no matter what the implementation is, the main idea is that you control the system and all the data and information produced by the system.",

One thing that is important to remember is that no matter what the implementation is, the main idea is that you control the system and all the data and information produced by the system. 304 Part III: Malware Inspection Online antivirus scanning is a cheaper alternative because there is no hardware and software to manage and maintain. Plus, most online antivirus scanning services are free or can be accurately described as having a zero dollar cost. The caveat is that whatever files you submit to them eventually become their property, and they can do whatever they want with those files and the information collected from those files by their systems. In reality, it is not really free. Some online antivirus scanning companies that offer this service for free sell the files and information gathered from those files. The most popular online antivirus scanning service is Google s VirusTotal, as shown in Figure 11-2. It is the most trusted and widely used in the industry. TIP Be mindful of submitting files for analysis, especially if they contain private or confidential information. If possible, such as in documents, remove all private or confidential information. If this is not possible, I suggest not submitting any of these files.

Aside from on-premise and online virus scanning services, there is another alternative. This alternative relies more on the open source community. This caters to researchers who do not have a budget to create their own on-premise antivirus scanning infrastructure and do not want to submit any samples to an online antivirus scanning service provider. The alternative is using ClamAV. ClamAV, as described by its publisher, is an open source (General Public License  GPL ) antivirus engine designed for detecting Trojans, viruses, malware, and other malicious threats. It provides a high-performance multi-threaded scanning daemon, command-line utilities for on-demand file scanning, and an intelligent tool for automatic signature updates. The ClamAV virus databases are updated regularly and posted online for download by users. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-premise virus scanning infrastructure and does not carry the privacy concerns of submitting samples to online antivirus scanning service providers.

The main idea is to prevent anyone or anything from having access to the malware code. Before exerting any effort, it is important to determine whether a file to be analyzed statically has protective mechanisms that will prevent the analyst from having access to the code. The most common protective mechanism that malware employs when it comes to protecting its code is encryption. The most common tools malware authors employ to accomplish this are crypters and real-time packers. Crypters are tools that encrypt malware code. Real-time packers, on the other hand, not only encrypt but also compress the target malware. It is important to identify whether a malware has undergone encryption through the use of a crypter or real-time packer before the attackers deployed it so that the appropriate decrypter or unpacker can be used to decrypt and unpack the malware. Unfortunately, an encrypted or packed malware renders static analysis useless. Knowing about a packed malware beforehand helps you conserve analysis energy by not bothering to put that malware into static analysis unless it has been successfully unpacked or decrypted. LINGO A packed malware is a malware file that has been encrypted and compressed by real-time packers. Most crypters and real-time packers have a specific decrypter and unpacker.",

LINGO A packed malware is a malware file that has been encrypted and compressed by real-time packers. Most crypters and real-time packers have a specific decrypter and unpacker. In cases like this, it is easy to decrypt or unpack the malware. The researcher can simply identify the specific crypter or packer used and then subject the malware to the appropriate decrypter or unpacker. The real challenge is when the identified protective mechanism does not have an appropriate decrypter or unpacker. This requires a manual unpacking session, which is a completely different topic. In this book, I will concentrate more on real-time packers since they are the widely used protective mechanism employed by attackers. The following are the most common packers: Armadillo http: www. siliconrealms. com armadillo. php     ASPack http: www. aspack. com aspack. html Chapter 11: Inspecting Static Malware 311     ASProtect32 http: www. aspack. com asprotect32. html     ASProtect64 http: www. aspack. com asprotect64. html     PECompact http: bitsum. com pecompact      UPX http: upx. sourceforge. net  It is important to be familiar with all the packers you can get your hands on and how they work.

Chapter 11: Inspecting Static Malware 313 TIP UserDB. TXT can be modified to include new packer signatures. Identifying whether a file is packed is just half the battle. The challenging part is to unpack it. An unpacked and unencrypted file makes it easier for analysts and researchers to proceed in the static analysis process. There are lots of tools out there that can unpack a protected binary, especially if the packer used is common. For those packers that do not have unpackers, reverse engineering is the key to unpacking the file. The analyst then has to weigh whether the time needed to unpack the binary manually is worth it or just proceed directly to dynamic analysis. In most cases, the latter is chosen. Most PE tools that are available in the market have the ability to unpack packed binaries. One of my favorites is PE Explorer (http: www.",

Again, do not execute any of the tools published on this site in a production network. Always treat tools such as this with great caution and suspicion. It is always better to use these tools in a controlled environment. PE Structure Verification Another indicator of whether a file is malicious is a malformed PE structure. A malformed PE structure often indicates an infection or a sloppy way of hiding malicious code. Having knowledge of the PE structure is critical in this static analysis technique. An abnormal field value, a non-standard section, or anything that appears off is a good candidate for further investigation. TIP In Chapter 9, I discussed the PE file structure. It is always good to refer to that chapter as reference when it comes to the different fields and their possible values.

I will go through the different tools, techniques, and processes of dynamic analysis to accomplish your goal of extracting information from dynamic malware and ultimately get to the bottom of the malware behavior and its main attack directive. Virtual vs. Bare Metal When it comes to dynamic analysis, there is always a dilemma about whether to use a virtual environment or a bare-metal machine to host the operating system in which the malware will be executed. In my humble opinion, it is not a matter of or but and. It is best to have both.",

Malware that is not virtual-aware can be executed and analyzed in a virtual environment, and malware that is virtual-aware can be executed and analyzed in a bare-metal environment. The researcher, with these two environment implementations on hand, gets the benefits these two setups have to offer as discussed in previous chapters. It is best to execute malware first in a virtual environment. If execution fails, the next step is to execute it in a bare-metal system. This is to see whether the malware is virtual-aware. If execution fails in a bare-metal system, further investigation is needed to determine why the malware failed to execute in these two environments. It probably has something to do with the lab setup. Chapter 8 discussed how to set up both virtual and bare-metal dynamic analysis labs. The chapter also discussed how to make the dynamic analysis lab malware friendly so malware execution will be successful as much as possible. That is the key in any dynamic analysis lab. A lab that is not malware friendly will have little chance of capturing dynamic malware behavior. Chapter 12: Inspecting Dynamic Malware 319 Dynamic Analysis When it comes to observing malware behavior, it can be divided into two parts. Host behavior     Network behavior In the early years of malware, dynamic analysis was confined to analyzing a malware s host behavior. The early malware did not have any network functionality. A dynamic analysis lab was a single isolated system. But with the advances of malware and its ability to communicate remotely with other malware and with its controller, it is a must to analyze its network behavior as well.",

But with the advances of malware and its ability to communicate remotely with other malware and with its controller, it is a must to analyze its network behavior as well. Therefore, when it comes to dynamic analysis collecting and analyzing, both the malware host and the network behavior must be studied. Analyzing Host Behavior Dynamic analysis is all about monitoring and capturing information from malware in a target or compromised system. To do this, it is important to understand fundamental malware behavior in an infected system; in this case, the dynamic analysis lab. For malware to accomplish its main directive, it has to do a number of modifications and actions in a target system. This is what you need to determine. Most of the actions the malware does in a compromised host are designed to achieve one or a combination of the following: Malware component installation     Malware persistency     Malware protective mechanism     Malware directive During infection or system compromise, the malware installs a copy of itself and other components if needed. This means additional files are added to the system without the victim s knowledge. In most cases, the malware is deployed using a dropper, a downloader, or a hybrid of both. 320 Part III: Malware Inspection The following are the most common locations where malware installs its components: Windows folder     System folder     Temporary folders A dropper is a malware installer that contains all the malware and all its components. It is like a typical software installer. Upon execution, it installs the malware and all its components, collectively also known as the malware package, to the appropriate location in the system. 1 A downloader, on the other hand, does not contain the malware package.",

Instead, it downloads the package to be installed from the malware-serving domains. A downloader is similar to a download manager used by some software vendors wherein the user downloads a small executable, which upon execution checks the system for compatibility and then downloads and installs the appropriate software package. The same thing is done by a malware downloader, except for the fact that it downloads and installs malware instead of legitimate software. 1 It is important to note that the downloader relies heavily on the compromised machine having an Internet connection. This is why dynamic analysis labs of today have a controlled environment that allows them to connect to the Internet when needed, especially if the malware needs to download its components. TIP When an Internet connection is needed for malware analysis purposes, always make sure that the Internet connection is not used by any system not designed to capture or analyze malware. It is also good practice to read and comply with the terms and agreements of your Internet service provider. The attackers understand that some of the systems will have a limited Internet connection. To solve this, a hybrid of a downloader and a dropper is often used to deploy malware.

Elisan, published by McGraw-Hill. Chapter 12: Inspecting Dynamic Malware 321 NOTE A downloader usually has a significantly smaller size compared to its dropper and hybrid counterpart since it does not have to bear the weight of the malware package. A hybrid and a dropper usually are similar in size. After installing all the malware components, the malware installer, regardless of whether it is a dropper, downloader, or hybrid, deletes itself and passes control to the newly installed malware components. The malware installer deletes itself to remove of any traces it was there. It is important to remember that the malware installer is a separate technical component of the threat ecosystem, and its value increases for every successful malware deployment it does without a sample of it being captured by researchers. You can find a detailed discussion of this and the threat ecosystem in Malware, Rootkits   Botnets: A Beginner s Guide, published by McGraw-Hill. The malware then proceeds to make sure it survives a shutdown or a reboot. This is where it sets itself up and the other malware components to be persistent. This is achieved by using different autostart techniques in Windows. The following are some of the autostart techniques: Hijacking the boot sector     Infecting system files     Adding the malware in the StartUp folder     Utilizing Task Scheduler     Utilizing the registry Utilizing the registry is the most common autostart technique used by malware.",

It does this by using some of the following techniques: Hiding using attributes     Hiding in plain sight     Using rootkit technology Although this technique is considered rudimentary, most malware today still utilizes file and folder attributes to protect itself. The most common way to do this is to set the attributes of the malware files and the folders they are located in to Hidden or System. This is designed to fool optical inspection by researchers and analysts. Even with the ability to override this using operating system settings and widely available tools today, malware is still using this technique. Another rudimentary technique is hiding in plain sight. The main idea here is that the malware components are dropped into a folder where there are thousands of files so they can blend in. The most common location utilized by malware is the Windows system folder. It contains lots of files that have names that are not easily recognizable, which is perfect for this kind of protective mechanism. One common way of hiding in plain sight is by using filename obfuscation by replacing the uppercase letter O with the number 0 (zero). Another one is by adding common strings as a prefix such as win to a malware filename or by simply adding 32 or 64 to the filename.",

You can learn more about rootkits and hiding in plain sight in Malware, Rootkits   Botnets: A Beginner s Guide, published by McGraw-Hill. The need to install malware components, make malware persistent, and protect the malware components  presence in the system sums up a malware s general initial host behavior. But this is just the tip of the iceberg; what you are really after is the malware directive. Depending on the attack type, a malware s directive can be a simple nuisance, destructive, or data exfiltration, among others. A malware that simply displays a message or reorient a screen can be viewed as a nuisance. A malware that deletes critical files in a system can be deemed as destructive. A malware that scrapes memory, captures the desktop, or logs keystrokes obviously is an information stealer. Identifying the malware s main directive requires a combination of monitoring and recording what s going on in the system after the malware has installed and protected its components and established its persistency.

File system changes can also be a good indicator of malware directive, especially if it has something to do with destroying files. It can also offer a glimpse of how it spreads through other systems such as infecting other files or creating bogus files for copying in local and network share folders. There are three changes to the file system that you need to monitor. Added files     Deleted files     Modified files Added Files As previously mentioned, during the malware installation stage, the malware usually drops a copy of itself and other components it needs to function. Most malware nowadays is deployed or installed using a dropper, downloader, or hybrid of both. If the malware utilizes a dropper or a downloader, the installation of malware components is similar to the installation of legitimate software. The only difference is that the dropper or downloader deletes a copy of itself after control is passed to the malware components.

Last but definitely not the least, the configuration file contains information for other components. It can contain system targets, special instructions, updated network resources, or any information the malware needs to function. Usually, configuration files are used to change the malware s behavior based on the attacker s need. NOTE Older malware attacks consist of only a single file; that is, the malware itself and all the component functions are coded into the malware itself, and updating any functionality means updating the whole malware file. Modern malware is modular. Each component is a separate file for easy updates by the attacker. Getting a copy of all these components enables the researcher or analyst to understand the malware s behavior better. LINGO Modularized malware is malware whose functions are assigned to different files and not coded into a single malware code. Chapter 12: Inspecting Dynamic Malware 325 It is also important to remember that most malware authors do not want to reinvent the wheel. If the functionalities they need are present in existing tools, they will use those tools as a separate module or simply copy that tool s code into the malware code. For example, if a malware wants to download files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), it might use known FTP download tools. This is why it became common during the heyday of network worms that malware usually utilized network tools used by network administrators. The advantage of this is that the tools will not be flagged as malware because they are known to be benign tools.",

The following are the most common files deleted by malware during installation: System restore files     Configuration files     Security product files If a malware is designed to be destructive and its main directive is to delete files, knowing what files were deleted will aid in identifying the malware s main file target and what files needed to be restored. Modified Files When file infectors ruled the threat landscape, the best way to tell whether a system was infected was by identifying all modified files and flagging them as possibly infected by a virus. This is the main reason why early antivirus solutions relied on cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and checksum. The idea here is that if a file s CRC changes unexpectedly from the previous check, it is infected. In today s threat landscape, the importance of identifying modified files during compromise is still important. It usually is an indication of system or third-party software files infected by malware or modified for a specific purpose that will aid the malware in its operation. One operation is extortion.",

Figure 12-26 Context menu of startup process. 348 Part III: Malware Inspection Analyzing Network Behavior As previously mentioned, modern malware has the capability to use different network resources for its malicious purpose. Malware can use network resources as a drop zone for stolen information, as a server for malware component updates, and as a command and control server where malware can interface with the attackers. In analyzing malware, it is important to understand its network behavior as well. When it comes to network behavior, it is important to identify the network resources the malware is connecting to. Identifying the domains or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that the malware connects to aids greatly in identifying the malware s main purpose and also helps in attribution if there is enough information available. LAB 12-5: Analyzing Network Behavior Using TCPView In this lab, you will analyze network behavior of a malware using TCPView. What You Need: Infected Windows system     Sysinternals Suite Steps: 1. Download and install Sysinternals Suite from https: technet. microsoft. com  en-us sysinternals bb842062. aspx. 2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired folder. 3. Go to that folder, look for TCPView (tcpview. exe), and open it. 4. If you do not want to download the whole Sysinternals Suite and want only TCPView, you can download it from https: technet. microsoft. com en-us  sysinternals bb897437. aspx. 5. In this experiment, you will be using the infected Windows system you used in previous experiments where you ran the infected malware.

Malware will reveal information only as it executes. It is possible that not all of its functions or capabilities will be revealed because they may require certain conditions that you are not aware of. It is therefore an accepted limitation of dynamic analysis that certain functionalities of the malware cannot be monitored and captured. This is the reason why dynamic analysis is a feedback system. Malware that produces little or nothing at all in the target environment is further analyzed to determine the reason why. In most cases, malware reversing is conducted to find out why. Any new findings or any new conditions identified to make the system malware friendly is then added to the dynamic analysis lab so that other malware that relies on the same conditions will execute as intended by the attacker, which will result in the monitoring and capturing of the functions or capabilities that rely on those conditions.

I touched on how virtual and bare-metal environments can complement each other instead of making a hard choice of just using one and not the other. I discussed the two areas of dynamic analysis that is important in getting to the bottom of modern malware s behavior. They are as follows: Analyzing host behavior     Analyzing network behavior In analyzing host behavior, I broke it down into monitoring and collecting data from the following areas of the dynamic analysis lab or target system: File system     Registry     Memory I discussed different tools and techniques in your lab to accomplish your goal of monitoring and recording data gathered from malware as it behaves on the host system and as it leaves traces while communicating through the network. I also discussed the limitations of dynamic analysis to end the chapter so that there is clear understanding of the advantages you can get from conducting dynamic analysis while also recognizing that not all information can be gathered because it is dependent on the malware s ability to execute within the environment.",

Familiarity with these tools and how to use them properly is the difference between success and failure in malware analysis. The use of tools to perform malware analysis has been discussed throughout this book. In previous chapters, I discussed how to use certain tools to perform static and dynamic malware analysis. The right tools together with the right skills are a powerful combination when faced with a difficult malware to analyze. In this chapter, you will take a look at more tools that are important when it comes to malware analysis. I consider them tools of the trade. Malware Analysis Use Cases When it comes to tool selection, it is important to understand first what you want to do and then choose the appropriate tool for the job. For example, if you want to know the file type of a suspicious file, you know that you can use PEiD or the Linux file command line. But if one of the things you want to do is to have the ability to add signatures so the tool can detect new file types or characterize a file based on your need, the best tool for the job is PEiD.",

The installer will parse the mirror for packages. If the speed is slow, you can always cancel the installation, restart it, and choose a different download site. 9. Once parsing is complete and available packages have been identified, you will be asked to choose the packages you want to install. Installing all packages is the default. Simply remove the packages you don t want. But for the purpose of this lab, you will install all packages. Click Next. 10. If there are dependencies needed by any of the packages, Cygwin will resolve them by installing the required packages to satisfy dependencies. Click Next. 11. The installer will begin downloading and installing the packages. This may take some time. Once this is done, click Next. 12. Choose whether you want to have icons on your desktop, Start menu, or both. Click Finish. 13. Installation is now complete. You now have Cygwin Terminal, as shown in Figure 13-3. 14.

Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 367 Debuggers In computer science, debugging is the process of finding errors or bugs in a program or a device. The tools that are used for debugging are called debuggers. In DOS, a reliable tool for this is Debug. COM, but the world of debuggers has come a long way after that. In malware analysis, debugging is the process of tracing code to find out what it does. It is a step-by-step tracing of malware code to determine its true intention. This is why debugging is a critical ingredient of reverse engineering. For the purpose of this book, debugging is a helpful process to determine whether a binary is encrypted, packed, or neither. Learning this skill is needed, especially if the packer or cryptor is new and no PEiD or Yara signature exists yet to detect it. Remember, any file that is encrypted or packed usually renders static analysis useless. But if a malware is unpacked or decrypted through the use of tools, it will be easy to get information from it using static analysis; thus, you have more data to help you classify whether a file is malicious and even cluster it with its group or malware family for better identification.

You can download it from http: www. ollydbg. de. One great thing about OllyDbg, called Olly for short, is that there is a wealth of plug-ins available for download all over the Internet to make debugging easier. A search for OllyDbg plug-ins will yield lots of resources when it comes to useful plug-ins. But as with other things available freely on the Web, exercise caution when downloading and using them. Immunity Debugger Immunity Debugger is a debugger that boasts of features that are deemed friendly for security experts. You can download it from http: debugger. immunityinc. com. On its main page, it is described as a powerful new way to write exploits, analyze malware, and reverse engineer binary files. It can also be extended by using a large and well-supported Python API. Windows Debuggers The most common Windows debuggers are WinDbg, KD, and NTKD. The one that encompasses all, at least in my humble opinion, is WinDbg. WinDbg is Microsoft s own Windows debugger. It is part of the Windows Driver Kit, but it can also be downloaded as a stand-alone tool from https: msdn. microsoft. com  en-us windows hardware hh852365. aspx.

Disassemblers A disassembler is a tool that breaks down a binary into assembly code. A disassembler is often used in tandem with a debugger. A debugger follows the assembly code in memory, and the output of the disassembler serves as a map or a good indicator whether the code being traced in memory is still in line with the disassembled code. Sometimes there will be differences, which means that either the debugging session is going to a dead end or the disassembled code is not as reliable probably because the malware has an anti-disassemble capability. The most popular disassembler is IDA. It is also considered a debugger. IDA is a little pricey, but the good thing about it is that there is always a free version available that is for non-commercial use. You can download it from https: www. hex-rays. com products ida support download. shtml. IDA is a powerful tool. I suggest downloading a free copy of it and playing around with it. There are lots of resources from its website that will help you get started. The more you use it, the better you will become at using IDA.

The first thing to do is to use PEiD to determine whether it is packed. 2. Figure 13-4 shows the output of PEiD. As you can see, PEiD did not detect anything. Even its Entropy shows that the file is not packed. Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 373 3. Let s try PEView. Figure 13-5 shows the output. You can see in the IAT that there are many imports, which oftentimes depict that the file is unpacked and everything looks normal. 4. Let s try IDA. Figure 13-6 shows the output. From here, you can see that there is only one function, the start function. Close to the end of the start function there is a CALL instruction to a value stored in the stack. The value is the return value of the function InverRect that was called before, and its return value plus 27C8Ah was stored on the stack. With this information, you come into the conclusion that this file is packed after all, even if PEiD and PEView say otherwise. 5. At this point, you need to drop the file into a debugger, look at the assembly instructions, and attempt to unpack the file. 6.",

After trying to animate over, you will notice the JMPs make it too difficult to follow, and thus a new approach is needed. You may have noticed that you stumbled upon the same CMP ECX, ESI instruction quite a few times while stepping over, so it seems that this is obfuscated code that might repeat itself in a loop 2, 950 times. The number 2, 950 comes from the hex value B86, which is the value of ESI, as shown in Figure 13-13. Figure 13-11 Immunity Debugger session reaching CALL EAX instruction.

There is an alternative strategy to reaching this JMP EAX instruction. Assuming that the packer is trying to hide any JMP to the deobfuscated code, a good bet is that it will call a function using a CALL EAX JMP EAX instruction. With that logic in mind, you can search (ctrl f) for a CALL EAX JMP EAX instruction and set a breakpoint (f2) on that instruction. Before pressing f9 to run, make sure you create a snapshot.

When you scroll down, you will see function names as strings in the code, as shown in Figure 13-22. 26. At this point, you come to the conclusion that this is still the packer code. Or is it the unpacker code? It looks like the packer is a string pointer to function names in the KERNEL32. DLL library by using GetProcAddress. This is done by the packer so it won t have to call these functions explicitly and there will be no trace of these functions in the IAT. Figure 13-19 Immunity Debugger Analyse Code menu option.

Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 407 Network Capturing Tools A malware s network communication can reveal a lot about malware, the most important of which is what data is being exfiltrated out. It also reveals the malware s network resources, such as its command and control if it is part of a botnet, its domain or IP drop zone if it is an information stealer, and its malwareserving domain or IP address if it has the capability to update itself on a regular basis. It is therefore important to capture any network communication a malware makes while it is executing in a controlled environment. The following are the three most common network capturing tools used in malware analysis: Wireshark     TCPDump     TCPView Wireshark Wireshark is a popular, versatile, and easy-to-use tool when it comes to capturing network traffic, as demonstrated in Lab 12-6 in the previous chapter.

Usually, when you get a sample, it is always assumed that it is a PE file, but this is not always the case. Also, using the different file type checkers in your arsenal such as PEiD and a Python script powered with Yara will help you identify not only the file type but also whether the file is packed, encrypted, or neither. 5.

From the strings output, notice the following strings: UPX0, UPX1, UPX! , and AutoIt. The first three are indicators that the file is packed by UPX, and the fourth string indicates that there might be an AutoIt script embedded in the file, which might be a second packer. 8. Investigate the file s PE characteristics. You can do this using PEView. Figure 13-41 shows the file s compile time. The compile time is found inside the PE structure as a member called TimeDateStamp in the NT headers. The compile time value should be taken into limited consideration because this value can be faked easily. 9. Figure 13-42 shows the file s machine value. The machine value is a member in the NT headers structure, and it can have one of two values: 0x014C, which indicates a 32-bit Windows PE file, or 0x8664, which indicates a 64-bit Windows PE file. Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 411 10. Looking at the PEView windows, it is easy to notice one section name. Sometimes the PE section name can give you some information about the file. In this example, the PE section names that can be seen are UPX0, UPX1, and. rsrc, as shown in Figure 13-43. UPX0 and UPX1 indicate that the file has been packed with UPX. PEView is the third tool that confirms the file is packed with UPX. The first two are the GNU file and strings command line. 11.

Regarding browser settings, from the logs you can see that the malware is overwriting a lot of the system s browser settings as well as deleting cookies and proxy settings. The reason for this is that the malware does not want any interference with its operation and is eliminating potential interferences by doing that. Another reason for cookie deletion and emptying different caches is that the malware wants the user to log in to websites so the credentials can be stolen. 29.",

Regarding deployment, the logs reveal that the malware copies itself to the C: Documents and Settings folder and eventually runs a batch file that creates and runs qyecy. EXE. 30. Regarding the persistency mechanism, the malware creates a registry key under HKCU Software Microsoft Windows CurrentVersion Run, which is a known registry location to execute files during startup. The key name is  9EBEC959-DCC9-EA18-5427-D5C9258D0AD8, and it contains the path to the malware s file location, which is C: Documents and Settings xxx  Application Data Ulkua soul. exe. 31. Also notice that the following registry event repeats itself every few seconds. This will re-create the malware s persistency in case someone intentionally deletes it. The malware also saves some encrypted configuration data at HKCU Software Microsoft Rupe Katifa. 32. Regarding malicious activity, at first glance it might seem that the file C: Windows directx. sys dropped by the malware is a driver and that the malware has kernel mode capabilities, but this is not the case. The filename was carefully picked in order for it to blend in with the rest of the files in that folder.

    "content": "EXE C: ThinApps SYSINT 1 ROOTKI 1. EXE 430 Part III: Malware Inspection This file is where the malware keeps a list of currently running processes. 33. You may have noticed that most suspicious registry events were initiated by a process named Explorer. EXE, which was running even before you ran the malware on the machine and is actually a legitimate Windows process that is responsible for Windows  graphical user interface (GUI) environment. Also, you may have noticed that some suspicious events happened more than once and were sometimes initiated by a few different processes that are also legitimate and were running before you infected the machine. The simple explanation for this is that this malware is creating a thread that runs the malware inside all processes that are already running on the machine. This process is called code injection or thread injection. When malware is injecting itself into a process, it is doing it to hide its process from showing when process listing occurs. This technique is usually utilized by a user mode rootkit. 34. Aside from code injection, another technique that is commonly used by user mode rootkits is hooking. User mode hooks are implemented in many creative ways; the most common techniques are IAT modification and inline patching. In IAT modification, the malware changes the IAT of each binary that is loaded by the OS in memory and changes the imported libraries and functions to their own malicious version of the same library containing the same functions with  extra functionality.",

In IAT modification, the malware changes the IAT of each binary that is loaded by the OS in memory and changes the imported libraries and functions to their own malicious version of the same library containing the same functions with  extra functionality. With inline patching, the malware will patch the code of the library in memory in a way that prior to the execution of the function, it will jump to the malware s code, and after executing the malicious code, it will jump back to the original function and continue with the original function s execution flow. Both methods will not be detected by checking whether any of the operating system s file integrity was compromised because the malware is doing all its work in memory. As a result, no traces will be found in the original files in the file system. NOTE Hooking techniques such as IAT modification and inline patching are also used by legitimate applications programs; therefore, the existence of hooks does not necessarily mean that the machine is infected with malware. Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 431 35. To check for hooks, you will scan the machine using Rootkit Unhooker. At this point, you should resume the VM and run Rootkit Unhooker. To scan for user mode hooks, go to the Code Hooks tab and click the Scan button. If there are code hooks on the infected system, it should look like Figure 13-53. 36.

By hooking functions in these libraries, the malware may be able to tamper with network traffic and set up a man-in-the-middle attack. 436 Part III: Malware Inspection 39. Next is dump analysis. This is done by taking a memory dump of the malicious process. In this case, the malware injected itself into each one of the running processes, with Explorer. EXE being the most significant. You will therefore pick Explorer. EXE as your memory dump s target. You can use either Process Explorer or Rootkit Unhooker to take a memory dump. 40. Dump a process with Process Explorer. Right-click the target process, which is Explorer. EXE, and go to Create Dump   Create Full Dump; then save the dump file. You can name the file MEMORY. DMP. See Figure 13-54. 41. Dump a process with Rootkit Unhooker. Go to the Processes tab. Right-click the target process, which is Explorer. EXE. Click Dump All Process Memory and save to a file. You can name the file MEMORY.

There is a more advanced way of doing this. For this purpose, you will use the Volatility framework. As previously discussed, Volatility is a Python-based framework that allows a user to analyze the OS environment from a static dump file. It has many plug-ins that are useful when it comes to memory analysis. You can find a list of its basic plug-ins in Appendix C. Volatility analyzes. VMEM files created by VMware. Volatility also supports other virtualization products such as VirtualBox. To get started, you need to suspend the VM prior to analyzing the. VMEM. 49. Once the VM is suspended, copy the. VMEM file to your working folder. Let s assume your. VMEM file is Sandbox. VMEM. 440 Part III: Malware Inspection 50. Find API hooks (user mode hooks) using Volatility.

What You Need: Static analysis tools     Dynamic analysis tools     Sysinternals Suite     PE viewers     Network capturing tools     OSR driver loader     System running Windows     Rootkit malware Steps: 1. You begin with basic dynamic analysis of the sample by running it in a virtual environment malware analysis system and monitoring all processes, the registry, and the file system by using the techniques discussed in Lab 13-7. Take note that the username of the analysis system is Jean, so you will see this in the output of the tools and some screenshots in this lab. 2. After infecting the VM, you monitor the following events in Process Monitor. 444 Part III: Malware Inspection Here is the ProcMon output: Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 445 446 Part III: Malware Inspection Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 447 3. The following are some things that are noticeable in the dynamic analysis session: A file named hexdefdrv. sys was written in C: Documents and Settings User Desktop hxdef100. A service named HackerDefender100 was created by writing values to the registry. This tells you that the malware is possibly installed as a kernel mode driver on the system, which is used to gain kernel rootkit capabilities. 4. Notice that all the files related to the malware have vanished. In Figure 13-56, you can see that the listed directory in the File Explorer doesn t actually exist on the desktop.",

After your initial analysis, you should have a picture of what kind of malware you are dealing with. You know that it installs a driver and that it hides certain files. You should now try to analyze the driver itself. 12. At this point, you should revert the machine to its original state before the infection so you can use a kernel debugger to see what the driver is actually doing and to extract the driver s files.

Once you hit the driver s entry point, you can start debugging it to see how it works by using the Step Over (f10) and Step Into (f11) functions. But it would be easier to dump the driver s module and analyze it with IDA first. 46. To do this, you create a snapshot of the debugged machine so you can continue debugging later with WinDbg, and then you pause the virtual machine. 47.

TIP Do not limit yourself to one sandbox implementation. Always collect information about a malware from other sandboxes and combine them to paint an accurate picture of the malware. Recap In this chapter, I discussed the common malware analysis use cases and how they should determine what goes inside a malware analyst s toolbox. I also noted that regardless of the use case a malware analyst is trying to satisfy, there are tools that are considered indispensable when it comes to malware analysis. I call them tools of the trade. They are as follows: Sysinternals Suite     Yara     Cygwin     Debuggers     Disassemblers     Memory dumpers     PE viewers     PE reconstructors     Malcode Analyst Pack     Rootkit tools     Network capturing tools     Automated sandboxes     Free online automated sandbox services Combining these tools the right way gives analysts and researchers a potent weapon in tackling the most difficult malware. In this chapter, you combined these tools to solve the most challenging use cases analysts and researchers always face. They are as follows: Manually unpacking a packed malware     Analyzing a user mode rootkit     Analyzing a kernel mode rootkit Chapter 13: Tools of the Trade 483 It is important to note that there are more tools out there; the main thing is to find a tool that you are comfortable with and that satisfies your use cases.",

Well-known examples are closing opening windows and shades or activating deactivating lights and fans. In literature such scenarios are counted to the IoT subarea of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and due to a close impact to the residents of homes a secure environments is essential. SecureWSNs (Schmitt 2020) are a powerful framework supporting different hardware and operating systems in the data collection process. Furthermore, they provide many services to residents in order for them to monitor environmental data (e. g. temperature, brightness, and humidity) within their home. To control network access, a finegrained access management solution is integrated alongside resourcespecific security protocols for required communication of components. Until now the system only supports monitoring of environmental data and lacks integration and controlling of actors establishing a comfortable zone to live at home fulfilling the concept of a CPS (Pahl 2014). As involved components usually work wirelessly, it is necessary to have full control of the network itself. Therefore, a secure solution to integrate actors (e. g. fans or lights) communicating over different standards (e. g. Bluetooth or ZigBee (Schmitt 2019)) into the deployed network is necessary. Furthermore, only authorized users should have the opportunity to configure the devices accordingly. This chapter summarizes the current situation, concerns and requests of smart home users, which are categorized and discussed to establish the design requirements for a SecureWSN establishing a prototyped CPS. Consequently, a SecureWSN is presented in detail with special focus on: (a) secure integration of two actors using different communication standards; and (b) handling the configuration of them while respecting privacy concerns (Porambage et al. 2016) of residents.",

If this check is passed successfully, the network owner is able to integrate the actors into the CPS. Furthermore, configuration details can be specified. Here, thresholds can be set when an actor (e. g. fan or lamp) should be activated or deactivated. Such thresholds can be modified during runtime in order to react to requirements (i. e. still too warm) immediately and flexible. In order to check if the actor works appropriately, two graphical user interfaces are available. The evaluation provided in this chapter is a proof of operation. Overall, it has to be kept in mind that home automation solutions might introduce risks and threats to an existing system, but this is overcome here by: (i) integration of several security checks for verification of ownership; and (ii) providing the user with a detailed and step-wise introduction for setting the system up. Besides these, the home owner receives (iii) physical security for the home by putting lights on when not at home or automatically cooling down the interior if it is too hot or vice versa, as well as monitoring the total smart environment. 1. 1.",

    "content": "1. Introduction Smart homes have been gaining increasing attention and have become more widespread by promising to deliver more cost-effective, energy efficient heating, enhanced security solutions, or autonomic adoption to personal preferences. Another driver is the ability to control the lights, media center and many other appliances without a switch but a smart voice assistant instead. Devices that enable these features are becoming more and more affordable, new product categories are yet to be developed and whole new product ranges to be explored. One such example is the  Ring Always Home Cam, an indoor drone, released by Amazon in September 2020 (Bünte 2020). This device monitors home security by patrolling the property room by room, notifying absent residents about potential security threats. Home automation (HA) can be seen as being part of a smart home, allowing it to perform actions autonomously to fulfill specified goals such as keeping the temperature at a certain level, closing the windows when it rains, or dropping the shades when the sun shines. However, most of the commercially available product solutions leverage several drawbacks such as the requirement to use the vendor-provided cloud for controlling and automating devices or the incompatibility of different manufacturer appliances or protocols. The enforced cloudconnection, in particular, may deter those who are privacy conscious given the nature of the data collected and how it is used by the vendors is not known (Bernheim Brush et al. 2011; Dague 2017). In order to enable monitoring and collection of environmental data, multiple sensors (also known as nodes) are combined to form a wireless sensor network (WSN).",

These WSNs are mostly built of constrained devices, meaning those with limited processing, storage and power resources. A SecureWSN (Schmitt 2020) is a framework consisting of three components: (1) The WSN component, which collects environmental data; (2) the CoMaDa1 component, which configures and manages the deployed WSN and handles receiving data; and (3) WebMaDa2, which provides the backend infrastructure of the framework and a web-based framework for mobile access. It makes it possible to create and maintain a WSN in a secure manner, enabling data gathering of multiple nodes within a network, featuring secure data transmission and additionally providing rich functionality for aggregating, monitoring, and visualizing the sensors data. WebMaDa follows the idea of a cloud-based approach but, due to its configuration in the WSN network, the owner has complete control of their network and settings without any involvement from the WebMaDa administrator, including the  right to be forgotten  if requested. Thus, WebMaDa is more secure than a classic cloud service provider. Additionally, if a user does not want to use or integrate a cloud connection, and does not rely on the remote service offered by WebMaDa, the system is also fully functional without the WebMaDa integration.",

Different node hardware running various supported operating systems (OSs) can be used to feed the system with environmental data, including temperature, humidity, noise or brightness measurements (Schmitt et al. 2013; Schmitt 2020). The remainder of this chapter3 is structured as follows: section 1. 2 presents all required background knowledge for the home automation solution, HAIFA. This ranges from the characteristics of a SecureWSN where the solution is integrated, common communication standards and machine-to-machine protocols, the monitor-analyse-plan-executeknowledge (MAPE-K) model that is applied, as well as hardware and libraries used. Section 1. 3 presents insights into the design decisions for the realized home automation solution HAIFA for a SecureWSN. Here, functional and architectural requirements are specified, the envisioned architecture introduced and further decisions justified. Section 1. 4 discusses the actual implementation of HAIFA, broken down into the requisite parts. In section 1. 5 the implementation is evaluated before drawing conclusions. 1. 2. Background This section introduces the background information required to understand the design decisions made in section 1. 3.

Second, important home automation concepts are introduced, including protocols for publish subscribe mechanisms (i. e. MQTT and CoAP), the fundamental MAPE-K model for triggering interaction between sensors and actuators, and related hardware and projects. 1. 2. 1. SecureWSN Figure 1. 1 illustrates the different components and their involvement in building the SecureWSN framework to monitor environments in smart homes buildings with constrained devices (Schmitt 2020). The collecting network is a WSN built of different types of constrained devices that use different operating systems   TinyOS, Contiki and RIOT OS (TinyOS 2021; Contiki-NG 2020; RIOT OS 2021)   and can be accessed via two components. These components are graphical user interfaces (GUI) called CoMaDa and WebMaDa, which offer the user an effective platform following the click mentality to configure and monitor the deployed network (Schmitt 2019). For the developed home automation solution HAIFA, the WSN component is assumed to be a black box and only delivers environmental data such as temperature or humidity. These values are used as input for HAIFA to trigger actuators (e. g. a fan or lamp). Thus, in the following, only CoMaDa and WebMaDa are described in more detail, as these are the locations where the implementation of HAIFA is placed. 1. 2. 1. 1.",

    "content": "1. 1. CoMaDa characteristics The implementation of CoMaDa follows a modular approach meaning its functionality can be easily extended with new features using modules. In fact, some of its core features are provided by modules, including one used together with nodes that run the specific operating system, providing the configuration and deployment interface for them and making it possible to program the actual hardware. General configuration and monitoring is enabled through modules, including one that makes it possible to access and execute commands via a secure shell (SSH) connection and another that deploys an administration frontend by acting as a small web server. This frontend makes it possible to configure the nodes and to monitor and visualize their data and topology with diagrams. Only essential details of the design decisions taken for HAIFA are presented in section 1. 3, answering the following two questions: How do modules work in general? How can these modules interact with one another? For further information, the reader is referred to Schmitt et al. (2013) and Schmitt (2020). Figure 1. 1.

Additionally, it enables subscription to certain message types that may be published on the bus. Custom-defined handlers are called by the message bus system when a new message is received, i. e. when any other participant of the bus published it. Example events are the NewNodeMessage, which is published whenever a new node is added to the WSN, or the WSNModuleAddedEvent, which is fired as soon as a new module is attached to CoMaDa.",

Example events are the NewNodeMessage, which is published whenever a new node is added to the WSN, or the WSNModuleAddedEvent, which is fired as soon as a new module is attached to CoMaDa. This system allows two different parts to react to specific events of the other one without having to know of or depend on each other. The WSN-Modules support feature-extensions in CoMaDa. Each WSNModule must extend the WSNModule class providing access to the actual WSN (i. e. the virtual representation of it) including its data (e. g. sensor values or the node topology) and to different services provided by other WSN-Modules as well. Several life-cycle methods are implemented (initialization, shutdown and post-shutdown) allowing the WSN-Module to execute necessary steps before actually running or shutting-down itself. Within the initialization of a life-cycle method a WSN-Module may register other WSN-Modules as dependencies, together with a callback handler. This dependency informs CoMaDa to call the registered handler as soon as the dependent WSN-Module is ready to use. Additionally, the handler gets access to the actual initialized WSN-Module allowing it to use available services. Each WSNModule implements a run-method containing the actual work of it running on a separate thread. The hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is generally used to serve websites on the Internet and so called HTTP-Controllers, provided by the WSNHTTPServerModule (HTTP-Module), enable CoMaDa to act as a web server, allowing it to serve a website.

Furthermore, any other module may depend on it to add its own HTTP-Controller to the HTTP-Module. Each controller is responsible for one namespace, i. e. one specific uniform resource locator (URL). This namespace is defined by the WSN-Module which attaches the controller to the HTTP-Module. A HomeAutomationHttpController, for instance, could handle requests sent to the  homeautomation  URL, including all sub-URLs (such as  homeautomation doSomething). Controllers may interact with their module (i. e. the one that added them to the HTTP-Module). Other functionalities, like adding a new entry to the main menu of the administration frontend is also available. Additionally, the HTTPModule is used by the TinyOSHelperModule, including configuration and deployment interfaces for the deployed nodes. The administration frontend is written as an AngularJS JavaScript application (AngularJS 2021). The main purpose of the respective library is to add dynamic behavior to websites rather than just serving a static site built with basic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). For that, AngularJS leverages the use of widgets, which support two-way data binding and are composed of an HTML template and a JavaScript component, also referred to as the model. This means the HTMLtemplate may use variables of the model maintained in the JavaScript component and updates the template (i. e. the actual view website) whenever data in the model changes. Additionally, the JavaScript component may also implement enhanced features such as handling clicks on a button of the template or sending HTTP-Requests to a backend, such as the one provided by the HTTP-Controllers of the HTTP-Module.",

The CoMaDa frontend itself is divided into several widgets with individual responsibility for the frontend. Those widgets can be added through the HTTP-Module, allowing any WSN-Module to add new widgets to the frontend. Allowing flexible interchangeability of concrete implementations, the dependency injection pattern is used in some parts of CoMaDa. As a result, which implementation should be used can be decided during runtime. For this, classes that obtain dependencies by injection require abstract interfaces that provide methods for all required services. The actual injected objects for these dependencies can be anything, as long as they implement the required interfaces. The Google Guice framework (see the Guice Dependency Injection Framework in GitHub (2020a)) is used to configure and perform the dependency injection in CoMaDa. The WSN-Framework is a component within CoMaDa that creates the actual WSNApp and attaches desired WSNModules to it. It is only one single class that contains the main Java method and additionally uses the Guice framework and a special configuration file to specify which WSN-Modules and implementations are required. The WSNApp is the concrete application managing the (virtual representation of the) WSN and comprises all attached modules and the global message bus, as well as all drivers and protocols required for the communication with the different nodes of the WSN. From this point, the terms WSNFramework, WSNApp and CoMaDa may be used to refer to the entire CoMaDa component (formally representing a framework) in general. 1. 2. 1. 2.

This decision contradicts the general request from users to also have access to the network while being physically apart from it. Thus, WebMaDa, the third component of SecureWSNs was developed over time in order to address this request for remote access. As illustrated in Figure 1. 1, each CoMaDa instance is connected to one global WebMaDa server to continuously upload the sensor data of the WSN via CoMaDa (respectively the gateway built out of the last node in the WSN and the CoMaDa component). In turn, WebMaDa can manage multiple WSNs as they are distinguishable due to unique IDs stored in a configuration file in CoMaDa (Schmitt 2019). WebMaDa s backend is written in PHP, while the frontend uses Smarty (a PHP render engine), the Bootstrap CSS, and the jQuery JavaScriptframework. The backend has access to a MySQL database (see Figure 1. 2), which is used to store data of each WSN and additional data like network s credentials or information of registered users. The frontend GUI illustrates the monitored data in different ways and allows pulling data out of reporting interval. For network owners an option to filtering data or to adjust privileges in fine-grained manner is also integrated (Schmitt et al. 2016a; Schmitt 2019). Figure 1. 2.

The Upload-Interface shown in the upper part of Figure 1. 2 enables CoMaDa to send data directly to WebMaDa by making HTTP-Requests to the upload interface endpoint (i. e. a specific URL) of WebMaDa. The Pull-Interface solves the problem of CoMaDa not having a public (static) IP-address or domain. The WebSocket server (WSS) is used to establish a connection from WebMaDa to CoMaDa (see bottom part of Figure 1. 2). The latter one registers itself at the WSS (whose domain is also public)   again by providing the credentials   and opens a WebSocket. Pull requests are sent from WebMaDa to its WSS using the open WebSocket to forward the query to CoMaDa. The two aforementioned interfaces are managed and used by a module called the WSNWebModule. WebMaDa in turn handles uploads in a PHP script executed on requests to the Upload-Interface. It also uses the WSS using HTTP-requests for communication via another backend script, sending pull requests to CoMaDa. Although the interfaces serve a special purpose by default, they can be used to transmit any type of data making them interesting for the envisioned HAIFA communication flow, with some extensions. 1. 2. 2.",

Communication standards As illustrated by a number of publications, several communication standards surround the IoT which foster the principle of machine-tomachine communication (e. g. IEEE 802. 15. 4, ZigBee, LoRa or NBIoT4) (Karl and Willig 2007; ZigBee Alliance 2012; Schmitt 2019; LoRa Alliance n. d. ). As the intended home automation solution requires a physical connection between several devices, this section introduces common protocols for a connection between actuators and gateways, as assumed in home automation. 1. 2. 2. 1. ZigBee ZigBee (ZigBee Alliance 2012) is a common communication standard for constrained networks targeting efficient resource consumption and short-range communication. It builds on IEEE 802. 15. 4 which represents the physical (PHY) layer and the medium access control (MAC) layer. The PHY layer is responsible for the actual data transmission over the physical radio channel (technical realization); the MAC layer enables reliable communication in a wireless network; this includes creating a personal area network (PAN) and assigning unique addresses (PANIDs) to devices that have joined the PAN. The IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard defines two types of device (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2020): (1) A full function device (FFD) is capable of operating as the (PAN) coordinator and is essential for starting and maintaining the network (2) A reduced function device (RFD) in comparison does not satisfy requirements to operate as a coordinator and is therefore intended for simple applications (e. g. light switches or passive sensors). Together, these two devices build a network, which can either follow a star topology or a peer-to-peer topology. In the first case, communication is only established between the PAN coordinator and joined devices. In the latter case, communication can be established between all devices within the range   except for communication between two RFDs.",

In the first case, communication is only established between the PAN coordinator and joined devices. In the latter case, communication can be established between all devices within the range   except for communication between two RFDs. The ZigBee standard (ZigBee Alliance 2012) extends IEEE 802. 15. 4 by two upper layers: the network layer (NWK) and the application layer (APL). The NWK layer coordinates routing between devices and organizes tree and mesh networks, while the APL layer provides the application framework hosting the application objects (i. e. the actual application) on ZigBee devices. As a result of this specification, ZigBee formally divides devices into three classes and therefore differs from IEEE 802. 15. 4: (1) the ZigBee coordinator function as a PAN coordinator and as a ZigBee router; (2) the ZigBee router is also a FFD controlling the personal operation space (i. e. in reference to IEEE 802. 15. 4, they act as a coordinator in their PAN) and is capable of route discovery within the network; and (3) the ZigBee devices (also called end devices) that are equivalent to RFDs (e. g. a light switch or fan). Linking the three device classes to a network usually results in a cluster or mesh topology. This means a ZigBee coordinator manages the network and can have connections to ZigBee routers and or ZigBee devices. Furthermore, several ZigBee routers can be connected to one another and to several ZigBee devices to provide backup routes in case parts of the network break down or a ZigBee gateway gets lost and the PAN functionality must be taken over (Karl and Willig 2007).",

ZigBee is most widely used in home automation systems, for example for smart bulbs, smart irrigation systems, smart door locks and many more components. ZigBee works well as a protocol for these devices, since none of them require high bandwidths and only provide a limited amount of energy, as many automation systems (e. g. a door lock or a surveillance camera) rely on the use of a battery. Further use cases of ZigBee have been demonstrated, e. g. the use of ZigBee in cars (Tsai et al. 2007), and also industrial and medical health care systems (Wheeler 2007; Lee et al. 2009) are increasingly making use of the protocol. 1. 2. 2. 2. Bluetooth low energy Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also referred to as Bluetooth Smart, is another standard for wireless personal area networks (WPAN). Compared to classic Bluetooth it was introduced to reduce power consumption in order to be used in constraint devices with limited resources, similar to ZigBee. Of a similar standard of traditional Bluetooth, BLE defines a network stack with several layers of which the two lower ones (the PHY layer and link layer) are implemented by the controller, which typically runs on the actual radio module. The host implements upper layers on the application processor and it may be extended by the application logic of vendors using BLE (Gomez et al.",

Unlike ZigBee, BLE is a point-to-point protocol, only allowing communication with devices within the direct physical range. Therefore, BLE is often used for smart devices that constantly require a connection to the same device, like smart watches or wireless headsets, which always have to be connected to a smartphone or computer to function properly. However, BLE is also used in other scenarios, like home automation, health care or indoor positioning (Gomez et al. 2012; Cabarkapa et al. 2015; Bluetooth Special Interest Group 2019). 1. 2. 2. 3. Publish subscribe protocols Besides the aforementioned two communication standards, special protocols for machine-to-machine communication for publish subcribe services were established over time. The most popular ones   MQTT and COAP   are briefly described here and a comparison is summarized in Table 1. 15. The message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol, defined by the OASIS6, is a publish subscribe protocol designed for machine-tomachine communication, especially for devices with limited performance, power supply, or bandwidth. All clients are connected to one MQTT server (also called the broker) and publish messages in topics. Topics are organized in a tree structure with subtopics (e. g. sensors kitchen temperature or actuators bedroom light) and can be subscribed to by clients. If a new message is published, the server sends this message to all clients that have subscribed to the topic in which the new message was published.",

If a new message is published, the server sends this message to all clients that have subscribed to the topic in which the new message was published. Usually, messages are only sent to clients after they have subscribed to a certain topic; except for messages with the retained flag set to true. The most recent retained message per topic is stored on the server and sent immediately when a new client subscribes to the corresponding topic. MQTT messages can be sent with three different quality of service (QoS) levels: QoS   0, delivers messages once without confirmation, hence, it is suitable for networks with high reliability but also high transmission costs; QoS   1, messages are resent if the sender does not receive an acknowledgment in time, which can lead to multiple deliveries of the message if the acknowledgment gets lost; QoS   2, messages are delivered exactly once, which is ensured by a two step acknowledgment process. QoS level 1 and 2 are used where bandwidth is not limited nor expensive but where delivery must be ensured; level 2 is used when it s particularly important to deliver a message exactly once. MQTT runs over the TCP IP stack but a separate MQTT specification   MQTT for sensor networks (MQTT-SN)   designed for use with non-TCP networks, like WSNs using the ZigBee protocol, was introduced in 2007. Apart from adjustments for characteristics of WSNs the MQTT-SN specification is very similar to that of MQTT.",

    "content": "Apart from adjustments for characteristics of WSNs the MQTT-SN specification is very similar to that of MQTT. MQTT supports security mechanisms for authentication of users through a valid usernamepassword combination. However, transport of MQTT is not encrypted by default, thus, passwords are transmitted in cleartext. In order to avoid this security breach, a transport layer security (TLS) encryption can be used; this additionally allows the client to authenticate the server by its certificate. Depending on the MQTT server in use, additional security instruments may be available. For instance, the Mosquitto MQTT broker supports restriction of user access to specific topics (Stanford-Clark and Truong 2013; OASIS 2019; Paessler 2019; Light 2020). The constrained application protocol (CoAP) has also been designed for machine-to-machine communication and follows the representational state transfer (REST) approach with a request response interaction model, thus, it shares similarities with the well-known HTTP protocol such as use of uniform resource identifiers (URI). CoAP differentiates four different message types: confirmables are messages that must be acknowledged with an acknowledgment message; non-confirmables do not need any confirmation and reset messages can be used to indicate processing of the message was not possible. Although the REST architecture is primarily designed for communication between a client and a server (unicast), CoAP offers additional multicast support which is often required by IoT applications. Unlike HTTP, with TCP CoAP uses a datagram-oriented transport protocol, typically the user datagram protocol (UDP). Additionally, the datagram transport security layer (DTLS) can be used to secure, i. e. encrypt the UDP transport connection (Bormann et al. 2012; Shelby et al. 2014). Table 1. 1.",

The element can be any target, from a low-level physical component (e. g. processor and storage) to a high-level software component (e. g. complex web server and home automation system). The manager consumes input of sensors (comparable to the SecureWSN nodes) and supplies them to the first phase of the MAPE-K cycle; in the end, this returns instructions for the actuators to manipulate (i. e. control) the managed element (Kephart and Chess 2003; Huebscher and McCann 2008). Figure 1. 3. MAPE-K model from IBM (Kephart and Chess 2003). For a color version of this figure, see www. iste. co. uk khatoun cybersecurity. zip The core of the model proposed by IBM is the actual MAPE-K cycle, which consists of the knowledge that may contain additional context and information   such as the prior mentioned policies   and the main four phases (Kephart and Chess 2003; Pahl et al. 2009; Pahl 2014). 1) Monitor: responsible for observing data (i. e. sensor measurements) that provide the required information for the remaining phases. Additionally, it processes the raw sensor data and provides comparable and normalized data (i. e. in reasonable and uniform units). 2) Analyze: data provided by the monitor may be analyzed, which means, e. g. checking two sensor values against each other or combining multiple sensor values (aggregation). 3) Plan: the planning component decides whether an action needs to be taken based on the analyzed data. This is where the knowledge is often required. It provides the configuration in the form of rules, thresholds, etc. and corresponding actions that should be taken if those rules apply or the thresholds are exceeded.",

Policies describe the goal of an autonomic element. Kephart and Walsh introduced a unified framework with three different types of policies, which are briefly summarized below (Kephart and Walsh 2004). Action policies simply define actions that should be taken if the element is in a specific state. They follow the form: If x, then y, where y is a set of actions to be executed when all conditions from a set x are fulfilled. Goal policies define the desired state and the element has to choose suitable actions to achieve this state autonomously. Goal policies are defined on a higher level than action policies, as the human entity only has to configure what the desired state is, not how to achieve it. Utility function policies generate a goal policy based on all potential states. This allows the element to change the current objective (goal policy) depending on the current state by evaluating all possible states and returning the best one. 1. 2. 4. Hardware and libraries As discussed in section 1. 2. 2. 1, each ZigBee network requires a ZigBee coordinator which creates and manages the network. To provide this functionality, various devices ( ZigBee sticks  or adapters) can be used. One of the most popular adapters is the CC2531 from Texas Instruments7. Equipped with 256 KB ROM and 8 KB RAM, it is not very powerful but is strong enough to maintain a small ZigBee network and is also very affordable (less than   10).",

However, if custom images should be flashed on the adapter, the CC Debugger (around   35) has to be purchased as well; sets including both the adapter and debugger are available for around   35. Another well-known adapter is the ConBee II from Dresden Elektronik8. Its specifications are comparable to those of the CC2531 but, with a price between   35 40, it is slightly more expensive, even though no additional device is required for flashing custom images. All mentioned prices are based on the Amazon shopping platform9. Several libraries that provide an interface to communicate with ZigBee adapters are available. In the following, a selection of these is briefly described as they appear to be promising for the envisioned HAIFA and can be integrated smoothly into the existing infrastructure. Zigbee2Mqtt and Zigpy natively support the two adapters mentioned, popular in smart home environments. ZigBee2Mqtt is written in JavaScript and runs within a Node. js10 environment. It supports several different ZigBee adapters to create a ZigBee network and handles the communication with connected devices, respectively actuators. The network and its appliances are exposed via MQTT, hence the library also requires a MQTT broker to be used properly.",

The network and its appliances are exposed via MQTT, hence the library also requires a MQTT broker to be used properly. Reading state information of actuators and controlling them is enabled through certain MQTT-topics. The main advantage of this library is the huge support of different ZigBee actuators. According to the documentation (Kanters 2020a), more than 1000 different devices are supported, including light bulbs, power switches, window shades, water sensors and many more. This means that for those devices, features such as adjustable brightness or color temperature can be set through the API, i. e. specific MQTT topics. An alternative library written in Python is Zigpy, which also supports numerous ZigBee adapters. It is also used by the Home Assistant implementation for their ZigBee integration and offers support for communication with various ZigBee devices. However, device-specific functions, such as with Zigbee2Mqtt, are not implemented or supported natively (Keller 2014; Chetroi 2020; Kanters 2020a). In order for the MQTT protocol to be used by multiple clients, a MQTT broker is required (see section 1. 2. 2. 3) (Light 2017, 2020). To host a broker such as this, various pieces of open source software are available. Two important ones are presented here as main representatives. Mosquitto is an implementation of the MQTT protocol, supporting the latest version 5 and implementing nearly all features of the standard. It is developed by the Eclipse foundation and available for all major operating systems including Ubuntu.",

It is developed by the Eclipse foundation and available for all major operating systems including Ubuntu. Support for TLS encryption with certificates is available as well as authentication of clients either via the username-password combination or also via certificates. RabbitMQ can be seen as an alternative to Mosquitto (RabbitMQ 2020). The broker originally implemented the advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP) but, in the meanwhile, support for MQTT and other protocols has been added. However, until now, MQTT support is only given for the older MQTT version 3. 1. 1. The software is available for all important platforms, too, and like Mosquitto, various authentication mechanisms are offered. Since the CoMaDa framework is written in Java, a corresponding Java MQTT client would be necessary to connect to a MQTT broker. Such a client is the open source implementation from HiveMQ, the HiveMQ MQTT Client (GitHub 2020b). The client supports MQTT version 5 and provides an API with various methods to subscribe to topics or publish messages within them. Credentials may be provided by username-password combinations, alternative certificate-based authentication is supported as well. 1. 3.

First, the identified requirements are specified, followed by a brief description of the HAIFA architecture. Finally, integration into the mobile interface WebMaDa is explained, which enables the system to be controlled remotely. 1. 3. 1. Requirements The envisioned HA solution HAIFA is expected to be integrated into the existing infrastructure of a SecureWSN. Thus, the infrastructure was analyzed in detail and necessary requirements (R) for the final design and architecture of HAIFA were specified. These requirements can be categorized into (i) functional and (ii) non-functional requirements. The second category also describe parts of the functional requirements (respectively requirements resulting from them) on a lower, more technical and implementation-related level. 1. 3. 1. 1. Functional requirements A HA by definition requires actuators in the system in order to change states in the local environment, based on decisions influenced by measurements or given thresholds. Changing a state can be done in two ways: either by changing the state of the actuator itself (i. e. switching a light bulb on or off) or changing the state of any device by the actuator (i. e. turning a power switch connected to a fan on or off). As these two simple examples show, actuators are available from many different vendors and they may use different protocols for communication with the bridge. The envisioned HAIFA should support different hardware and protocols (R1) by acting as a bridge for more than just one manufacturer and, thus, enabling interoperability between different vendors and device types. In general, it should be possible to extend support for other variants as well.",

In general, it should be possible to extend support for other variants as well. Integration of actuators (R2) is essential for the system to work and be useful, thus, all actuators connected to the HAIFA should be controllable and manageable by the user through the HAIFA. An actuator should be unregistered by default, which means no interaction with it is possible. By registering an actuator and assigning a name to it, it will be possible to control it and use it according to certain rules. This additional registration step ensures that the WSN-Owner is definitely aware of attaching a new actuator to the system. Only registered actuators should be controllable remotely through WebMaDa. Controlling an actuator means executing supported actions or commands on it, such as turning a light on or off, changing the brightness of the light or toggling the on-off state of a power switch. A rule-based configuration (R3) may be provided and managed by the WSN-Owner (respectively the residents of the home in general) to define the desired behavior of the actual automation. The owner should be able to create rules that define conditions and actions. Conditions are composed of any sensor s value, a comparator, and a threshold; for instance: if the temperature of node 3 is below 23 degrees.",

Additionally, rules should be pause- unpauseable and time frames may be assigned to them to define certain time slots in which the rule is allowed to perform actions, e. g. On Mondays from 8 am to 9 pm and on Fridays from 3. 15 pm to 4 pm. The actions should be performed when all conditions are satisfied and they can be one of the available commands offered by any registered actuator. Furthermore, conditions as well as actions are not limited to one single node or actuator. Thus, it should be possible to add an entire set of conditions based on different sensor values as well as actions performed on different actuators to one single rule. Changes to rules (including editing, pausing un-pausing or deleting them) as well as the history (i. e. timestamps) of the last checks and executions of them should be logged. These logs should be made available to the WSN-Owner through a user interface. There are several use cases conceivable where remote access to adjust rules and thresholds (R4), add new rules or control actuators is useful or required. Examples are adjusting the thresholds of a rule controlling the heater in a room or ensuring lights are turned off. Therefore, it should be possible to control registered actuators and mange rules remotely. WebMaDa should be used as the remote endpoint since it already comprises the data and its visualization of the deployed WSN, as well as a user and permission management system. 1. 3. 1. 2.",

    "content": "1. 2. Non-functional requirements Besides the functional requirements given in section 1. 3. 1. 1, four more requirements were identified that are essential to ensure that the system is reliable and can function properly. These requirements are briefly described here. In order to permanently save registered actuators (especially their assigned name), configured rules and their corresponding logs storage (R5) are required. Available storage options (such as databases, file storage, etc. ) may vary from system to system, thus, the storage should be represented by an abstract interface while the actual implementation of it is interchangeable. WebMaDa is required to store data (namely available actuators, rules and the logs) as well. However, as it is a closed system responsible for multiple CoMaDa instances, interchangeability is not required here. Thus, the existing database used by the WebMaDa backend should also be used for the new HA data. Since CoMaDa runs on devices with limited resources, the HAIFA must not consume too much storage. Therefore, stored logs (R6) on a CoMaDa server should be cleaned up regularly, keeping only the most recent ones. WebMaDa, on the other hand, is not that limited in terms of resources. Hence, no cleanup is required there, which means the history for the entire lifetime of a WSN can be looked up. Actions, defined in rules (R7), are executed when the corresponding conditions are satisfied. This requires some sort of periodic regular check to determine whether the conditions are fulfilled or not. In order to make the integration of configuration into the administration frontend (and WebMaDa) easier, all components within the HAIFA should be able to convert themselves into a JSON representation and backwards (R8)11. This is required because JavaScript on a frontend can only handle JSON data objects.",

In order to make the integration of configuration into the administration frontend (and WebMaDa) easier, all components within the HAIFA should be able to convert themselves into a JSON representation and backwards (R8)11. This is required because JavaScript on a frontend can only handle JSON data objects. Moreover, Java has also integrated support of JSON data types. The JSON notation can also easily be used to store the state of actuators and the configuration of rules in the database, respectively the storage. 1. 3. 2. HAIFA architecture Taking into account all eight of the above requirements results in the HAIFA architecture being realized, as illustrated in Figure 1. 4. As HAIFA is required to be integrated into the existing infrastructure of a SecureWSN, and may be further extended by actuators in the future, the focus is on simple extension opportunities. Thus, HAIFA has been divided into several components and sub-parts, each of which has its own clear domain of responsibility, as outlined in section 1. 3. 2. 1. More details about the flexible and expandable approach realized are given in section 1. 3. 2. 2. Figure 1. 4. High level architecture of the HAIFA model.

The core module for HAIFA is the home automation module (HA - Module) as it is responsible for the core task realized by the MAPE-K cycle and triggers the actuators based on the decisions taken. Thus, it needs to work together with the Automation-Worker to observe applied rules and the WSNApp, which is responsible for getting the data from the collection points in the deployed WSN. In the following, we describe these parts from a design perspective and, in section 1. 4, from an implementation perspective. The home automation module (HA-Module) is the main entry point of the entire HAIFA, orchestrating communication with any other part of the WSNFramework, respectively CoMaDa and especially the WSN itself, and ensuring a properly executed start of the HAIFA. According to Schmitt et al. (2013), it will act as a WSN-Module and be attached to the WSNApp (i. e. CoMaDa) during the bootstrap process of the framework. Besides handling communication and data flow between the different modules, the WSNApp and all other components of the HAIFA, it is responsible for the startup of those other components and initializing any required dependencies.",

The sequence diagram in Figure 1. 5 shows this startup procedure: initially, a client   usually the WSNFramework, which is responsible for the initial assemble and boot process to create the desired CoMaDa instance   starts the HAIFA by creating a new HA-Module. Next, the module leverages the storage to get registered actuators and stored rules and starts the above-mentioned components. The client may attach new gateways at any time. The HA functionality will be integrated into CoMaDa by HAIFA. This HAIFA will be one WSN-Module, thus, in the latter part of this chapter, the term HA-Module refers to the specific  entry  component, while the term HAIFA is used to refer to the entire system (i. e. the entire WSN-Module) in general. Actuators are the devices with which the actual automation is physically performed. It may be any device, such as light bulbs or power switches. Technically, each actuator is represented by one single Java object which may be used by any other component of the HAIFA. All available actuators are held and provided by the core HA-Module. Each actuator supports the execution of at least one command.",

The HAIFA provides abstract interfaces for generic actuator types like lights or switches, while gateways provide their actual implementation, which may vary depending on the gateway. Commands represent low-level, elementary actions which may be supported by actuators. In this case, low-level and elementary means that commands are not specific per actuator. Instead, each command describes a generic action that might be supported by multiple actuators and cannot be further simplified. Example commands are turn on or turn off, both of which are applicable for multiple devices. To allow additional customization commands may require one ore more arguments such as set brightness (value) where value would be an argument specifying the desired brightness to be set. The last command is, of course, not as generic as the two previous ones but still not only suitable for a single device. Figure 1. 5. HAIFA startup sequence The logic and functionality of how to (physically) control and manage actuators is not integrated into the core of the HA-Module because this approach would lack a clear separation of concerns and complicates two main objectives: concurrent support of multiple device, vendor and protocol types, as well as extending support for new actuators. Both would probably require code changes and logic adjustments in a component that should not be responsible for managing physical devices, since the HA-Module must be seen as the organizing part of the entire system, delegating low-level tasks to sub-components.

    "content": "Gateways are used to overcome this issue. A gateway is the connection between virtual representations of actuators, their corresponding physical device, and the HA-Module, respectively the entire HAIFA. They handle communication between those parts, also notifying the HA-Module whenever new devices have been added (by the WSN-Owner). As indicated in the sequence diagram in Figure 1. 5, gateways can be attached to the module at any time (after it has loaded the registered actuators from the storage to recognize them). A gateway may act as the physical endpoint for connected actuators, e. g. by directly acting as or using a ZigBee coordinator (see section 1. 2. 2. 1) and, thus, as the coordinator of a network with multiple actuators. However, gateways may also use additional (external) services to provide their functionality. Figure 1. 6 shows how a client (again, this could be the WSNFramework) can create a new gateway and add actuators to it. The gateway in turn attaches itself to the HA-Module (retrieved by the client having access to it) and announces each new actuator. These are also added by the client, i. e. in this case mostly the WSN-Owner, who connects the physical devices to the gateway. The client may retrieve all actuators from the HA-Module and execute supported commands on them which are forwarded to the physical device by the gateway. This also shows that other components never interact with any gateway directly, as the HA-Module provides access to all available actuators.",

For a color version of this figure, see www. iste. co. uk khatoun cybersecurity. zip In order to enable actual automation the WSN-Owner may create socalled rules following detailed instructions step-wise pointing out guidelines related to security issues that might occur. To ensure that only the WSN-Owner adds or modifies rules, credential checks are continuously performed and the AAA (authentication, authorization and accounting) principle from security fundamentals is applied (Boyd and Mathuria 2010). Generally, many different types of rules may be supported. They abstract the execution of actions, i. e. commands on actuators, combined with some sort of condition. While this HAIFA prototype only implements condition rules (see section 1. 3. 1. 1) other types of checking the need for execution than conditions on WSN nodes, such as keeping a node s sensor value on a certain level, are thinkable as well. The abstraction is ensured by forcing rules to implement a certain interface and, thus, providing two services: one to check whether actions have to be taken (i. e. all conditions are fulfilled) and another to perform those actions on the actuators.",

While actuators, commands and rules can be seen as the configuration part of the automation, the automation part is not yet provided by any component. It will be undertaken by the Automation-Worker, whose main task is to regularly check for all rules, whether any of them are required to perform actions based on the current values of the nodes in the WSN. If so, it uses the second service of the corresponding rules to do so. Additionally, providing access to all actuators and WSN nodes to the rules ensures their proper functionality and allows them to first decide if all conditions are satisfied and then to execute the necessary commands on the actuators. Finally, the Automation-Worker creates log entries for every check and every execution of the rules via the HAModule. Figure 1. 8 shows a sequence diagram of one iteration of the automation cycle and its interaction with the HA-Module and the configured rules. At first, the worker retrieves current setup rules, nodes and actuators and then checks if actions are required and, if so, lets the rules perform them.

It may be used to manage the automation rules, register or unregister actuators, execute commands on registered actuators, and provide access to the logs of the rules. All available endpoints for the user (WSN-Owner) to access and manage the HAIFA and how they interact with it are shown in Figure 1. 9, including the HAHttpController for local (i. e. from within the network CoMaDa is deployed in) as well as the WSNWebModule for remote access via WebMaDa. The WSNWebModule (see section 1. 2. 1. 2) already exists and is responsible for the communication between CoMaDa and WebMaDa (upload and pull interfaces).

The original CoMaDa system has already been extended by an external (PostgreSQL) database enhancing logging possibilities and local storage of data (Ott 2017). In order to ensure interchangeability of the database system, the HA-Module only requires an abstract interface that defines required methods for operating as the IHAStorage (i. e. the storage interface used by the HA-Module). However, the reference implemented storage will be integrated into the existing database. This avoids multiple concurrently running database management systems in the background and data of all CoMaDa modules will remain in one single source of truth. 1. 3. 2. 2. Expandability support One of the main goals is to easily allow extending features for components introduced in section 1. 3. 2. 1, or even exchange complete implementations of single components like replacing the PostgreSQL storage with a MySQL database for instance. Therefore, expandability in particular is supported and endorsed for the following three items for HAIFA. Rules: the abstract rule interface with services to check for necessary actions and execute them ensures that different rule implementations are supported and can easily be integrated into the system. In addition, only the management frontend endpoints (administration frontend in CoMaDa and WebMaDa) would have to be adjusted to create new rule types such as these. The Automation-Worker on the other side would not require any adjustments. Commands: adding new commands might become necessary when new devices with new functionalities are integrated into the HAIFA. Since the actuators (gateway implementations) take care of how to execute a command, new ones only have to be integrated into a globally available list of commands.",

The gateway implementations need to provide actual implementations of them to make use of the new type. Aside from these three items, gateways are the most important part in terms of flexibility and multi-device and multi-protocol support (especially interoperability of different automation device vendors). As they are only attached to the actual HA-Module, it is easy to implement new gateways or extend the support and features of existing ones. The only requirement is to satisfy the interface in terms of actuators and commands, more precisely, to keep the list of connected actuators up to date and to provide them as implementations of the abstract definitions to the HA-Module. All other components only interact with the devices through the consistent interface, never having to interact with gateways and vice versa. 1. 3. 2. 3.

The following paragraphs present decisions taken for the final ZigBee gateway for HAIFA. In order to get the most out of the single implemented gateway, the decision is mainly based on the general availability of devices.",

    "content": "The following paragraphs present decisions taken for the final ZigBee gateway for HAIFA. In order to get the most out of the single implemented gateway, the decision is mainly based on the general availability of devices. The Smart Homes Report 2018 shows that, in the UK, the Philips Hue12 and Hive (Hive Home n. d. ) together share 60  of the smart lighting market (YouGov 2018); both vendors use the ZigBee protocol for inter-device communication, common other vendors like IKEA or Osram rely on ZigBee as well. Furthermore, ZigBee is better suited to HA scenarios due to the native possibility of using a mesh network topology. Since devices within an apartment may be distributed across several rooms, some of them may lack direct connection to the coordinator device (the bridge). Hence, other appliances can act as ZigBee routers to enable communication with the network for such devices, too. Thus, HAIFA uses ZigBee instead of Bluetooth Low Energy. Furthermore, the existing infrastructure of the SecureWSN is already using ZigBee. We have decided to use the Texas Instruments CC2531 coordinator based on the simple fact that it is the most affordable solution. Initial costs for the adapter and debugger are approximately the same as for the ConBee II; if more adapters are bought in the future, however, the debugger does not need to be purchased again and the actual adapter is much cheaper. The CC2531 adapter and the debugger are shown in Figure 1. 7, on the right. Appropriate hardware has to be used to test the implemented HAIFA and the ZigBee gateway. We decided to use two light bulbs because of their widespread use in consumer home automation. Additionally, one power switch is used as this type of actuator provides great flexibility in terms of controllable devices.",

Additionally, one power switch is used as this type of actuator provides great flexibility in terms of controllable devices. All devices used are shown in Figure 1. 7, on the left. In order to communicate through the CC2531 adapter, one of the two libraries presented in section 1. 2. 4 should be used. Both cannot be integrated into CoMaDa directly as Zigbee2Mqtt is written in JavaScript and communicates via MQTT, while Zigpy is written in Python. The decision to use the Zigbee2Mqtt library is based on two reasons: (1) simple integration and (2) device support. Even though both libraries cannot be integrated directly into CoMaDa, it seems to be easier to integrate a MQTT client into CoMaDa to connect it with the library. In addition, Zigpy would also need some sort of integration bridge into CoMaDa. This would probably end up like a  Zigpy-to-Mqtt  component or similar, written in Python and also requiring CoMaDa to act as MQTT client. Zigbee2Mqtt natively supports many home automation devices including those shown in Figure 1. 7. Zigpy lacks such an integration and would require adding support for each device manually. The Zigbee2Mqtt library already supports MQTT. However, it would be possible to fork the existing repository and add an integration for the CoAP protocol. There are two reasons why this is not done. First, the MQTT approach is better suited to the CoMaDa concept. For now, only the HAIFA would use the MQTT client to access and control actuators. But there are potential scenarios where other WSN-Modules (or CoMaDa itself) may use this integration as well.",

But there are potential scenarios where other WSN-Modules (or CoMaDa itself) may use this integration as well. For instance, it would be possible to integrate ZigBee devices (especially various sensors) as nodes into the WSN requiring a new driver to access devices via the Zigbee2Mqtt library. While CoAP does have a multicast support, MQTT and its topic system would work very well in such a scenario. Every interested module could just subscribe to specific topics of interest (such as values of connected sensors) or publish messages to control any device within the ZigBee network. The CoAP integration would require more logic to support this multi-usage. Second, it would mean additional effort to implement CoAP into the library while the MQTT solution already exists and works flawlessly. Hence, HAIFA will use MQTT instead of CoAP. Figure 1. 10. HAIFA ZigBee gateway with communication flows Figure 1. 10 illustrates the composed HAIFA ZigBee gateway. On the right side is the actual CoMaDa framework, where the Zigbee2Mqtt gateway communicates over an (external) MQTT broker with the corresponding library. The CC2531 adapter is used to maintain the ZigBee network, shown on the left side. This also demonstrates a not yet mentioned advantage of the architecture: since the library is a standalone application and not integrated into CoMaDa, both are locally independent. Hence, the ZigBee network may be set up in a completely different location than CoMaDa, such as in a garage while the CoMaDa server runs inside the house. The only requirement is that both are connected to the Internet if the MQTT broker is exposed to it or, if not, both are connected to the same network.",

The only requirement is that both are connected to the Internet if the MQTT broker is exposed to it or, if not, both are connected to the same network. The realized setup integrates both the MQTT broker and the library into the CoMaDa instance. The Zigbee2Mqtt gateway implements the abstract actuator types (e. g. light bulb and power switch) defined by the HAIFA. But instead of providing one implementation per supported physical device, actual supported commands should be dynamically added to the virtual device objects. This only requires a configuration file to be provided with each supported physical device, its actuator type and all of its supported commands. Mosquitto is used as the MQTT broker due to the simple fact that it supports MQTT v5 and is only built to act as MQTT broker, hence, it has no overhead by supporting other protocols like RabbitMQ does. Client-wise, the HiveMQ MQTT Java client allows the Zigbee2Mqtt gateway to connect to the broker. 1. 3. 2. 4.

The knowledge consists of the rules set by the WSN-Owner, and define the desired behavior of HAIFA. Referring to the MAPE-K policies, those rules would be action policies as they define actions (command executions on actuators) that should be taken if the chosen conditions (node value thresholds) are met. As illustrated in Figure 1. 3, CoMaDa already provides the monitor and analyze part of the MAPE-K cycle.

CoMaDa also already provides data in consistent units and additionally supports aggregation directly within aggregation nodes. The interval of the periodic checks may be adjusted by the WSN-Owner. The two missing parts   plan and execute   are more or less combined within the Automation-Worker. During the periodic checks all rules are traversed and executed if their conditions are all fulfilled. Thus, instead of actually planning the execution, the worker directly executes actions of satisfied rules.

It might seem that periodic monitoring could also be replaced by constantly monitoring sensor values by subscribing to the corresponding event that is fired by the WSNApp whenever new sensor values are received by the framework, in order to improve the reactivity of the HAIFA to changing environmental parameters. We decided against this approach for two reasons: first, this would probably lead to a very high frequency of checking and executing rules depending on the amount of connected nodes and how frequently they push new sensor values; second, even though it is possible to include values of multiple node sensors into one rule, updates of sensor values are received one by one. Thus, on receiving an update of a node used in such a rule, other required values might not have received an update simultaneously. In this case the latest values pushed before could be used for all  missing  nodes, but to simplify the general process this has been omitted. 1. 3. 3. WebMaDa integration In order to address the general user request of mobility, WebMaDa should be integrated into the HAIFA for configuring rules and executing actions on actuators. This requires some sort of communication between WebMaDa and CoMaDa, which is the single source of truth in terms of connected actuators and rules. The solution used for this information exchange and the database design that will be used to store required data on the WebMaDa server, which is described next.

Currently, each available kind of message (e. g. C_SENS0R: upload new measured sensor value to WebMaDa; or PULL: send new pull-request to CoMaDa) are sent in their separate upload pull message. Received messages are processed by message-specific handlers on both sides. However, to keep the required changes inside of the existing implementation as small as possible, a new message type will not be implemented, along with a new handler for each possible  home automation event. Instead, only one new message type   a home automation message   is used to bundle all available events and types of information that need to be transferred between the two SecureWSN parts. This approach also makes it possible to support old versions of CoMaDa which do not yet include the new HAIFA, along with other required adjustments. Due to the modular structure and concept of CoMaDa this is an essential requirement. Additionally, adjustments are required for the WebSocket Server, since it currently only creates messages of type PULL. Figure 1. 12.

Furthermore, a Node Data Mapping table exists as each node in the deployed WSN exposes several sensors and provides their data. These datums are used within the rule conditions, hence, to create and update rules via WebMaDa it is also necessary to know the correct mapping of sensor datum name to the corresponding unit. WebMaDa indeed is already aware of these mappings as they are stored in the reports (i. e. values of the nodes) uploaded by CoMaDa. But to decouple the HAIFA from the rest of the WebMaDa features, a separate table will be used and kept up-to-date by CoMaDa (through periodic uploads). The respective table  wsnid _ha_node_data_mapping(node_id, datum_id, name, type, unit) will store name, type and unit for each node-datum combination available in the WSN. As per definition, each table is unique per virtual WSN, wsnid  will be replaced by the actual id of the related WSN. In order to keep validation and overall logic of rule creation within CoMaDa, WebMaDa does not directly create rules.

Furthermore, CoMaDa always updates rules, actuators, rule logs and node-datum mappings as soon as they have been changed by uploading them to WebMaDa. 1. 4. Implementation The realized prototyped HA solution HAIFA requires several implementation parts to build the final HAIFA-module: (1) the HAIFAmodule needs to be integrated in CoMaDa; (2) a ZigBee gateway; and (3) a connection establishment between CoMaDa and WebMaDa. 1. 4. 1. CoMaDa integration In this section, all abstract interfaces for actuators, rules, conditions and gateways, as well as core classes such as the HA-Module, the Automation-Worker, and the storage implementation are specified. The following definitions of terms are used: the term HAIFA (-Module) always refers to the entire WSN-Module implementation of CoMaDa and the term HA-Module refers to the core component as defined in section 1. 3. 2. 1. 1. 4. 1. 1. Interfaces and core classes Figure 1. 13 illustrates all interfaces used within the HAIFA-Module. Only the integration with the WSNWebModule for WebMaDa communication is not shown (see section 1. 4. 3). The central endpoint of the HAIFA-Module is the actual implementation of the abstract WSNModule class, namely the HA-Module organizing the communication and the setup of all other components. As shown in Figure 1. 13, all main parts of the HAIFAModule are represented by interfaces, thus, actual implementations can be exchanged with less effort. Section 1. 4. 1.",

Several options to achieve this are available. For example, uploading the current mapping once on CoMaDa s initial bootstrap, however, nodes may be added afterwards or have not been announced yet. Therefore, the HA-Module registers an event handler (shown in Listing 1. 2) for the SensorUpdateMessage published whenever new node sensors (data types) are available. Unfortunately, this message is published whenever a node sends its template and also for each datum separately. Thus, multiple update messages are sent for every node at a constant interval depending on how the node has been programmed (how often templates are published). In order to prevent too frequent updates this handler is only allowed to be executed every NODE_LIST_UPDATE_PAUSE_MILLISECONDS ms (realized in lines 2 8 of Listing 1. 2). Additionally, to ensure all sensors are included in the update it is deferred for NODE_LIST_UPDATE_DEFER_MILLISECONDS ms (see line 11) as usually the first update message of multiple (new) SensorUpdateMessages triggers the handler, but all of them should be included into the mapping, of course. This has been implemented by running the update on its own thread (updateThread) which sleeps for the desired amount of ms before actually publishing the updated mappings. Further handling and use of creating and publishing corresponding HomeAutomationUpdateMess ages is clarified in section 1. 4. 4. The mentioned mappings are created by the getWsnNodesAndData() method, shown in Listing 1. 3. It creates a JSON array containing an object for each available node (nodeInfo in line 4). Each node object contains an array with all sensors of the node, including the name, type, unit and current value of the sensor (see lines 6 17).",

Actuator, commands and arguments In order to provide a uniform interface of accessing and controlling actuators (IActuator), interfaces for available actuator types (ILight and ISwitch), as well as an abstract base implementation of a generic actuator (Actuator) are provided by HAIFA (see Figure 1. 14). Each actuator is of one specific ActuatorType and supports one or more Commands. All available commands are represented by an enumeration (enum) which holds information of how many additional arguments are required, along with their respective descriptions and a reference to the enum type of the required argument. The Number Argument is implementing the Argument interface and its loadFromString(String value) method is used to create the argument. Therefore, they are provided as strings by the administration frontend or WebMaDa. Actuator implementations of gateways may then use provided arguments to execute commands properly. Those implementations shall of course be aware of the required argument types per command. ArgumentTypes hold a reference to their implementing class. Thus, the right class from which the argument has to be created can be easily obtained by getting required arguments from a command and then getting the implementing class from the argument type (enum).

Two conditions are available in HAIFA, as illustrated in Figure 1. 15, which are (1) the NodeThresholdCondition and (2) the TimeFrameCondition. The first condition allows us to verify that a specific sensor value is given. Therefore, it saves the identifier of a node together with one of its sensors, an ICondition. Comparator (e. g. smaller, equal, or greater) and a threshold. It is considered to be fulfilled when the given sensor value compared to the threshold according to the comparator yields true.

HAIFA s gateway interface Gateways encapsulate the connection to different physical actuator devices, thus, a uniform interface is required to attach them to the HAIFA, specifically the HA-Module (see Figure 1. 6). Listing 1. 4 shows this interface and its four required methods. This results from the limited number of tasks for gateways, which mainly consist of adding and removing actuators to and from the HA-Module. Actuators, on the other side, have an internal reference to the gateway that they were created by and are controlled through their own interface. During the creation of a new gateway by a client, the HA-Module must be assigned to the gateway (setHAModule(. . . )). The gateway will then attach itself and connected actuators to the module using methods provided by the HomeAutomationModule illustrated in Figure 1. 13 (linkGateway(. . . ), addConnectedActuator(. . . ), and removeConnectedActuator(. . . )). The implementation of the reference ZigBee gateway is described in section 1. 4. 2. Listing 1. 4. The gateway interface 1. 4. 1. 6.

By creating a new thread from the Automation-Worker  as Runable  and starting it (see Listing 1. 1), the execution of the nm() method is started.

By creating a new thread from the Automation-Worker  as Runable  and starting it (see Listing 1. 1), the execution of the nm() method is started. The method itself then periodically executes the execute () method, realized by letting the thread sleep for the desired amount of seconds (see lines 15 20). The sleep period can be set by an additional method not shown in the listing, through the HA-Module. The execution-method performs the actual work, but is also not very complex. First, all available nodes, actuators, and automation rules are retrieved from the WSN, respectively the HA-Module (lines 24 26). Second, all of the rules are checked to determine whether they are paused, and if not, if they are required to take action. Execution is only performed if both checks turn out to be true. Rules provide this check and execution logic through their interface. The worker does not need to know how to verify the need for execution nor how to do it. This abstraction allows the code of the Automation-Worker to be very simple, as it is only responsible for triggering all rules to check and execute their actions regularly, and giving them access to all nodes and actuators (see line 33 and 34). One additional task is to log the outcome of the checks, as shown in lines 33 49 in Listing 1. 5. Depending on whether a rule is executed or not, and if yes, whether any actuator changed its state or not, the corresponding log-type (see Table 1. 2) is used to log an action for the rule using the method provided by the HomeAutomationModule shown in Figure 1.",

The PostgreSQL storage implementation   fetch all rules The provided solution in HAIFA s prototype is the PostgresStorage class implementing the IHA-Storage interface. It utilizes the PostgreSQL database already available on the currently used CoMaDa VMs. The schema of the database tables is introduced in section 1. 3. 2. 4 and since most of the statements required for the different methods are more or less similar, the exemplary getRules () implementation is shown in Listing 1. 7. A short SQL statement fetches all stored rules from the database (see lines 5 8). For each rule the id, rule type, rule, and paused columns are retrieved. The rule column stores the latest JSON representation of the rule, while the rule_type column holds the name of the class implementing the related rule type. Thus, it can be used to create an instance of the right rule class (see lines 13 14). Even though only ConditionRules are supported for now, this ensures the compatibility of other rule types with the storage system in the future. This compatibility is also ensured by how the rule is loaded, namely by a method provided by its related class (loadFromJson(. . . )). Lines 15  18 show how the rule object loads itself from the JSON representation retrieved from the database. Thus, each available rule type takes care of how to parse the JSON, load, and create required data (e. g. conditions and executions).",

Thus, each available rule type takes care of how to parse the JSON, load, and create required data (e. g. conditions and executions). The connection to the PostgreSQL database is realized through the same library initially used to access the database from CoMaDa in (Ott 2017). Within the PostgresStorage class, this connection object is provided by the getConnection () method, returning the active connection or establishing it if it has not yet happened (see line 5). 1. 4. 1. 8. Administration frontend Adding the possibility of dynamically adjusting the configuration (i. e. registering actuators, managing rules, and viewing logs) is essential for the HAIFA to be really useful. Two mechanisms are provided for that: First, the CoMaDa administration frontend is extended by management features for the HAIFA. Second, WebMaDa can be used to manage rules and execute commands on actuators. In section 1. 2. 1. 1 the WSNHTTPServerModule was introduced, providing access to HTTP-Controllers, allowing the creation of sites within the frontend13. The HAHttpController extends the WSNHTTPController and serves a configuration page for the HAIFA (see Figure 1. 16). The controller itself is registered by the HA-Module under the namespace  homeautomation, as shown in Listing 1. 8, and provides endpoints (i. e. HTTP URLs that can be accessed by the AngularJS frontend under the  homeautomation  path) to fetch available nodes, rules, logs, and update rules, for example. Schmitt et al. (2013) describe how these endpoints (each represented by a single method in the HAHttpController) and paths function, in detail. The setupHttpController() method is called by the WSNApp as a result of registering the HTTP-Module as a dependent module for the HA-Module (see section 1. 2. 1. 1), as shown in line 4 of Listing 1. 1.",

The user can provide a configuration file which defines where log messages should be stored or outputted to (e. g. output to the console, into a file, and database), and what minimum level is required by the message to be handled. Logging has been integrated everywhere where it makes sense in the HAIFA, where keeping the balance between necessary and too much information. Listing 1. 14 shows, how a logger can generally be  retrieved  and how log messages of different levels are actually logged. The exemplary logging output in Figure 1. 19 results from adding a new gateway to the HA-Module, cleaning up the rule log, and one rule-check cycle where the actions of both available rules are not executed, due to unfulfilled conditions. Log messages like this, stored in a log-file, may help the WSN-Owner to solve problems by checking if rules were correctly checked and gateways were added properly, for example.",

The architecture of the reference ZigBee Gateway was introduced in section 1. 3. 2. 3, including the usage of the Zigbee2Mqtt library. The upcoming sections describe how this library is installed on the CoMaDa VM server and how the connection with the ZigBee adapter is established, and are followed by a presentation of the CoMaDa side gateway implementation. 1. 4. 2. 1. Installation and setup of the environment Zigbee2Mqtt (also called  bridge  in this chapter) is written in JavaScript and, thus, requires the Node. js environment to be executed. Additionally, a MQTT broker is required and is used by the bridge and the gateway to communicate with each other. Mosquitto (see section 1. 2. 4), is used as the broker.

While the Mosquitto MQTT broker runs immediately after the installation is exposed to the default MQTT port 1883 (OASIS 2019) in the local network, the bridge has to be started manually (see section 1. 4. 2. 3). Traffic sent between the different MQTT communication participants (broker and clients, i. e. bridge and gateway) is additionally encrypted using TLS with a self generated certificate and secured by requiring a valid username-password-combination. To allow easy starting, stopping, and monitoring of the bridge, it will be registered as a systemd service (systemd 2020) named Zigbee2mqtt. service. This allows the WSN-Owner to manage the service with the following commands: systemctl start Zigbee2mqtt. service to start the service; systemctl stop Zigbee2mqtt. service to stop the service; and   journalctl   u Zigbee2mqtt. service -f to view the logs of the service. The HTTP-Controller of the gateway, presented in section 1. 4. 2. 4, will also use this service to start and stop the bridge. This allows the WSNOwner to do so via the administration frontend. 1. 4. 2. 2. Connection of the ZigBee adapter to Zigbee2Mqtt The ZigBee adapter has to be connected to the bridge. In order to flash a custom image for Zigbee2Mqtt on it, the CC Debugger from Texas Instruments is used (Kanters 2020a, 2020b). After successfully flashing the image the adapter can connect to the server entity of the CoMaDa server. The access to it is then provided through a file handle by Ubuntu. Figure 1. 20 shows this file handle along with another handle reflecting the sink14 of the WSN.",

Configuring and controlling the Zigbee2Mqtt bridge The configuration of the bridge is realized through the configuration file presented in Figure 1. 20. For instance, setting the first option (permit_join) to true or false allows new devices to join the network or not. For the sake of security this should be set to false as soon as all required devices have been added to the network. The mqtt section defines the hostname (server) and credentials of the MQTT broker, as well as the base topic, which is used by the bridge. In this example the MQTT broker additionally requires authentication and provides TLS encryption, thus, the corresponding certificate has to be known (path defined in the ca config-string) by the bridge to verify the integrity of the server. However, every change to the configuration file requires a restart of the bridge, thus, the second option available for configuration changes is more convenient: the bridge exposes all of the configuration settings in certain MQTT topics and listens in on other topics, allowing those parameters (with an exception of the MQTT host settings of course) to be changed. The permit_join setting can be adjusted by publishing a message with either true or false to the zigbee2mqtt bridge config permit_join topic, for example. Figure 1. 20.",

A simple configuration file shown in Listing 1. 15, provided by the WSN-Owner, contains this mapping for the three devices used. The file contains one JSON-object with all of the used vendors as keys, which again all have supported device-models as keys. The device-objects include the class that should be used to represent the device and a list of all supported commands. The example shows that this approach allows different supported commands for two actuators of type light, without having to consider it in actuator implementations or use two distinct classes. Listing 1. 16 shows a shortened version of how the gateway creates correct instances for every newly connected device. The deviceList variable contains all of these new devices (line 1), and for all of them, the deviceMeta information is used to get the correct actuatorConfig object (see Listing 1. 15, the entire object is exposed through the vendorModelMapping class variable). Then, an instance of the defined class can be created and all supported commands are added to the new actuator instance (see lines 18 33).

Actuator instantiation for ZigBee gateway Additionally, the Zigbee2MqttGateway can be used to change the permit_join parameter of the bridge and request a (force-)removal of a connected device. Force-removals may be necessary if a device has been reset and, thus, is not able to  leave  the network by itself (usually the network coordinator requests a device to leave the network). The HiveMQ MQTT Client is used to connect to the MQTT broker, subscribe to topics, and publish new messages. Listing 1. 17 shows an example of how a topic can be subscribed to and how messages can be published. All of the topics used by the Zigbee2Mqtt bridge are listed on the corresponding documentation website (Kanters 2020b). Listing 1. 17. HiveMQ MQTT Java client usage Listing 1. 18. ZigBee gateway actuator setDeviceState(. . . ) method Actuator classes implement two interfaces, the IActuator and one of the type-interfaces, such as the ILight and ISwitch. In the ZigBee Gateway each actuator extends the generic Zigbee2MqttActuator, which provides (among others) the important setDeviceState( MapCString, Ob j ect  state) method. It can be used to send a request to the bridge to set certain values of the state (by publishing a message in the corresponding topic of the actuator). In Figure 1. 21 such a request is shown to set the brightness to the value 350. The different implementations of the actuator types (Light and Switch, see Figure 1. 22) only have to handle command executions for every possible command for that type. For example, a switch would never execute the set_brightness command, hence, it must not handle it. A light might execute this command in general, even though some lights probably do not support it.

The values are stored as a Java-Object in the map because multiple types are possible: e. g. String for ON  OFF and Integer for a brightness value. Command executions in the actuator implementations are realized using a switch statement. The corresponding method for a light is partially shown in Listing 1. 19. Depending on the command, the state map is filled with the related value-name (e. g. brightness and color_temp) and the corresponding new value (see lines 12 21).

The Upload- and Pull- Interface shared between WebMaDa and CoMaDa must be extended to be capable of exchanging other messages than just sensor data and pull requests and, additionally, a new frontend interface must be integrated into WebMaDa, allowing the WSN-Owner to control actuators and manage rules. Different database tables are created for each virtual WSN in WebMaDa, they are mainly used to store the sensor values for now. To be able to store HAIFA data, they will be extended by the four new tables shown in Figure 1. 12. Furthermore, a migration script is added to WebMaDa, creating the missing tables for already existing WSNs. This allows the WSN-Owner to seamlessly enable the HAIFA-Module in CoMaDa, while WebMaDa will create all of the necessary tables for the WSN. However, WebMaDa has to be opened once to trigger the migration before any HAIFA data can be uploaded. 1. 4. 4.",

    "content": "1. 4. 4. Uploading HA data to WebMaDa The WSNWebModule generally features uploads to WebMaDa. Therefore, it registers message-handlers for messages, which are published on the message bus by other parts of CoMaDa whenever a new data upload is required. Every possible message is processed by a separate handler and, thus, has its own message event that is published. Some examples are the NewNodeMessage or SensorUpdateMessage. However, to keep the impact and changes of the HAIFA to the WSNWebModule as small as possible, only one new message type is introduced: the HOME_AUTOMATION_MESSAGE. Its upload is triggered by the publication of the HomeAutomationUpdateMessage (see Listing 1. 20) on the message bus. This class includes an enum (see lines 14 16) with all actual available message types uploaded to WebMaDa by the HAIFA. As soon as any of the related events occurs, e. g. a new rule is added, or a new actuator is registered, the corresponding part in the HA-Module creates a new HomeAutomationUpdateMessage with the correct HA message type (in the example the RULE_LIST_UPDATE or ACTUATOR_LIST_UPDATE type) and publishes it on the bus (shown in lines 16 20 of Listing 1. 2). The WSNWebModule listens to this event and uploads the message to WebMaDa (see Listing 1. 21). The QHandler annotation registers the method as the handler for published messages, with a class type given by the first argument of the method. It then delegates the data-upload to the designated uploader. Listing 1. 20. Message class forHA updates Listing 1. 21. Handler for uploading messages to WebMaDa Listing 1. 22. WebMaDa s upload handler for HA messages WebMaDa on the other side processes uploads through corresponding handlers for each message type.

Thus, a new message handler for the HOME_AUTOMATION_MESSAGE has to be added. Each handler implements the handle () method, which is invoked whenever a new message for this handler is received by WebMaDa. The HomeAutomationHandler processes incoming messages based on the  internal  HA message type (see Listing 1. 22). The excerpt in the listing includes the handling of adding a new rule log entry, however, other messages are processed in a fairly similar way. SQL procedures are available for every access to the database, the one used for adding rule logs is shown in Listing 1. 23. The required data (including WSN-ID, rule ID, log-type, log timestamp, and JSON-representation of the rule) are handed over as arguments (see line 1 6), while the actual insertion into the database is realized by a simple INSERT-statement shown in line 13 15. The handler in Listing 1. 22 calls the SQL procedure with respective values from the received message to insert the new rule log into the database (see lines 25 34). The  pdo object provides access to the MySQL database of WebMaDa.

Listing 1. 24 shows how the script refers the request to the WSS, adding the type homeAutomationMessage to it in line 2 to let the WSS know which type of request to forward to CoMaDa. The curl-functions of PHP are used in lines 8 13 to first initialize the curl-request, configure it, and finally send the curl-request, i. e. a HTTP-Request to the WSS.

This does not change the previous behavior and thus enables backwards compatibility. Other than that, the WSS mainly works in the same way as before. Listing 1. 25 shows how different message types are differentiated and processed. Pull-queries are handled exactly as before with only one difference: the handling has been outsourced into a separate method, along with a new method for HA messages; a switch-statement determines the right method to use (see lines 10 18). HA messages are forwarded to CoMaDa using the new HOME_AUTOMATION_MESSAGE type and include the payload retrieved from the WebMaDa frontend (see section 1. 4. 6 and Listing 1. 24). Detailed explanations of how the WSS builds requests and sends them to CoMaDa are given in (Schmitt et al. 2016a). Listing 1. 25.

It is implemented using the Smarty template engine added to WebMaDa in Schmitt et al.

Figure 1. 24 shows the entire page, which follows a similar structure as the CoMaDa equivalent shown in Figure 1. 16. It allows commands to be executed on actuators and automation rules to be managed, for which the edit dialog is shown in Figure 1. 25. Bu using JavaScript and jQuery, the frontend is capable of sending requests via the WebMaDa backend script to the WSS (see Listing 1. 24), which forwards them to CoMaDa (see Listing 1. 25), where they are finally handled (see Listing 1. 26). As shown in Listing 1. 27, such a request is sent using the ajax service exposed by jQuery. This service allows HTTP-Requests of all different types (e. g. GET and POST) to be sent, arbitrary JSON encoded data to be attached to it (see lines 5 10), and success or errors to be handled in separate functions (see line 11 and 12).

These three objectives result in four requirements for HAIFA: (R1) HAIFA shall facilitate the easy integration of different types of actuators in terms of hardware, vendor, and or protocol meeting O1. (R2) WSNOwners will be able to configure automation of the actuators based on rules, while the sensor values of nodes are used to define certain thresholds, triggering the rules to be performed. In addition to thresholds, time frames may be defined, allowing rules to only be executed during the specified times slots. Hence, R2 relates to O2. (R3) derives implicitly from the request to integrate HAIFA into an existing SecureWSN and, thus, HAIFA needs to be compatible to all supported platforms using CoMaDa.",

The management of rules should be possible from both systems and the information history of when a rule has been last checked or executed should be displayed. R4 related to O3. The upcoming section proves that HAIFA fullfills the requirements R1-R4 and O1-O3 accordingly. 1. 5. 1. Actuator interoperability (R1) The gateway approach was selected for HAIFA to support the integration of many different actuator devices, and therefore the ZigBee gateway was implemented and configured accordingly, as described in section 1. 4. 2. Its functionality is tested by executing various commands on connected actuators. Figure 1. 16 shows that connected actuators are attached correctly to the HA-Module by the gateway after they have been setup and integrated into the configuration file, according to the gateways design specifications. The gateway s functionality is verified in section 1. 5. 2, where the rule automation, including executing commands on actuators, is evaluated. In order to extend the support by protocols other than ZigBee, a new gateway can be implemented in a similar manner. All required interfaces are clearly defined and the ZigBee gateway serves as a blue print for the implementation. 1. 5. 2.",

Node 1 is placed in front of a fan (or vent), and Node 2 is outside of its range. The vent is plugged into the Ikea ZigBee power switch, and an Osram ZigBee light bulb is placed next to it. Node 2 is powered by batteries, Node 1 by an USB power adapter and, thus, its operating temperature in the room is much higher (approx. 30 C) than Node 2 (approx. 22 C). This is caused by the heat of the power adapter. Figure 1. 26. Testbed for rule evaluation. For a color version of this figure, see www. iste. co. uk khatoun cybersecurity. zip Figure 1. 27. Testing the rule configuration The goal of the performed test is the verification of multiple layers of the realized rule system of HAIFA. Three items are investigated: (1) correct interaction when using multiple different sensor values in condition thresholds, (2) performing commands on more than one actuator, and (3) the correct interoperability of more than one rule together. During the testing period it should be ensured that the temperature of Node 1 stays in the range of 25 C to 26 C. A fan is used to control the situation and it is turned on and off if a rule is matched. For testing multiple conditions in one rule the temperature of Node 1 should only be kept in the desired range if the temperature of Node 2 is above 19 C. To cool the device below 19 C, the device is placed into a fridge. The light bulb should be turned on whenever the fan is turned off and vice versa.",

To cool the device below 19 C, the device is placed into a fridge. The light bulb should be turned on whenever the fan is turned off and vice versa. Two rules are created to maintain the explained scenario and their configuration is depicted in Figure 1. 27. Rule 1   Vent-On-Light-Off   means the fan is turned on and the light off if the temperature of Node 1 is above 26 C and the temperature of Node 2 is above 19 C. Furthermore, the rule should only be executed within a specified time frame (here 10: 00 a. m. to 3: 50 p. m. ). With Rule 1 the correct function of multiple conditions and time frames can be proved. Rule 2   Vent-Off-Light-On   causes the fan to shut down and the light to turn on if the temperature of Node 1 is below 25 C. The detailed process of the testing is summarized in Table 1. 3, along with an expectation regarding the actions taken by the HAIFA and the expected impact on the temperature of Node 1. During the test, the temperature of both nodes is monitored using the visualization features of WebMaDa and CoMaDa, as illustrated in Figure 1. 28.

Node hardware interoperability (R3) This integration test verified the proper implementation of the following features as the expectations from Table 1. 3 were fully fulfilled: (i) rules are checked and executed properly if all conditions are met, (ii) multiple given conditions need to be satisfied in order to execute the commands, as defined in the related rule, (iii) time-frames define valid slots in which rules are executed, outside of the respective windows no execution takes place, and (iv) commands are executed properly on the corresponding devices (and also on multiple actuators). Thus, the rule automation system has been successfully evaluated and R2 for HAIFA is fulfilled. The design and implementation of the HAIFA does not have any direct dependency on the actual node implementations, nor has it been changed or adjusted in any way. Instead, the HAIFA uses the virtual representation of the WSN provided by the WSNApp. This abstract layer is implemented by the corresponding driver for the OS, and respectively, the driver and required protocol handlers must provide necessary data to the WSNApp to be able to maintain the virtual WSN. Therefore, as long as any driver correctly integrates itself into the framework, the underlying node hardware or OS does not matter at all. However, to practically verify this statement a test has been implemented on a CoMaDa system running a network of OpenMote B nodes under RIOT OS and a network with TelosB nodes under TinyOS.",

No problems were recognized while creating rules and setting thresholds on the node sensor values of these OpenMote nodes. This test verified the node hardware interoperability. 1. 5. 4. CoMaDa and WebMaDa management (R4) The proper integration of both administration frontends has been tested in several ways. First, commands on actuators have been executed using both endpoints, including commands that require arguments such as setting the brightness. Second, rule management (creation, adjustment, and removal) has been performed on both sides. In fact, the rule setup has been created twice: once using the CoMaDa frontend and a second time within WebMaDa. Furthermore, the upload of rule-logs to WebMaDa has been checked manually by inspecting the database of WebMaDa and visually by visiting the rule log on the WebMaDa frontend. Since all of these tests have worked flawlessly, the management integration of CoMaDa and WebMaDa has been implemented correctly. 1. 6.

    "content": "Summary and conclusions A powerful Home Automation Framework has been designed and integrated into a SecureWSN framework, as presented in this chapter. It integrated itself seamlessly into the existing application and the modular concept of CoMaDa allowed the module to be added to the existing setups of the SecureWSN easily. Smart home devices, i. e. actuators, can be controlled through the framework while the interoperability of different manufacturers and communications standards is ensured by the flexible gateway approach. A gateway is the core entity for communication with physical devices. They are attached to the HA-Module, and are thus made available to all of the other components of the HAIFA. To demonstrate the functionality of the overall architecture a reference ZigBee gateway has been implemented using a ZigBee adapter, along with a third party library to control ZigBee enabled smart home actuators, such as power switches and light bulbs. The actual automation is configured using a rule-based system, where the conditions on certain sensor values have to be fulfilled in order to perform the desired actions on connected actuators. The sensor values are provided by existing entities of the SecureWSN project. All of the different node hardware and OS combinations supported by CoMaDa are compatible with the presented HAIFA. Configuration management and monitoring of rule execution is available throughout both user endpoints of the SecureWSN framework: CoMaDa for the local deployment, setup, and (initial) configuration, as well as for registering actuator devices in the system, and WebMaDa for remote rule management and command executions on actuators from anywhere in the world. Clear APIs have been designed and applied to the implementation in this thesis (reflected in the several interfaces and abstract classes), which allow easy interchangeability and extension of existing or new components of the HAIFA, also including the modular gateways.",

    "content": "Clear APIs have been designed and applied to the implementation in this thesis (reflected in the several interfaces and abstract classes), which allow easy interchangeability and extension of existing or new components of the HAIFA, also including the modular gateways. The final evaluation demonstrated the correct functionality and cooperation of all newly designed and implemented features of the module and the HAIFA in general. Overall it was shown how actuators can be integrated in a smart home solution, independent of vendor specific gateways or applications, also giving the owner the freedom to integrate their own specifications, work-flows, and implementations. This may introduce risks and threats to the system, but here it is overcome by: (i) integration of several security checks for ownership verification, (ii) providing a detailed and step-wise user guide allowing people who are not tech-savvy to work with it as well, and (iii) logging all changes. Further, (iv) HAIFA also offers home owners physical security. For example, the home owner can make it appear to the outside world that they are present, even though this is not true, and thus deter burglars. Elsewhere, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can be automated on given boundaries, establishing feel-good environments. 1. 7.

Sometimes it is also called a base station (Karl and Willig 2007). 2 Smart Home Device Security: A Survey of Smart Home Authentication Methods with a Focus on Mutual Authentication and Key Management Practices Robinson RAJU and Melody MOH Department of Computer Science, San Jose State University, USA 2. 1. Introduction The last decade (2000 2010) saw the remarkable inflection point where the number of inanimate things connected to the Internet overshot the world s population. This happened in 2008 when the number of devices connected to the Internet became greater than the world s population of around 6. 7 billion people (Moh and Raju 2018).

IoT  (Internet of Things), IIoT  (Industrial Internet of Things), CPS  (Cyber-Physical Systems) are the common terms that are used to describe the ecosystem of these  smart things. IoT is a network of interconnected computing devices with the ability to transfer data over a network without needing human interaction (Moh and Raju 2018). CPSs are a subset of IoT devices that not only connect to the Internet but also act on the physical environment that they are deployed into. These  smart devices  have become ubiquitous and have pervaded almost every sphere of people s lives. There are now  smart homes  in which devices in the home connect to the Internet and can provide data to the residents, smart medical appliances  that not only monitor remotely but also administer medicines in a timely fashion, smart bridges  that have sensors to monitor load, smart power grids  to detect disruptions and manage the distribution of power, smart machinery  that has embedded sensors in heavy machinery to increase worker safety and improve automation, and so on (Moh and Raju 2019). As devices become more miniature, the usage of BSNs (Body Sensor Networks), which are wearable computing devices, either implanted or placed on the body, is also on the rise (Raju et al. 2018). According to some estimates, over 100 new devices connect to the Internet every second (Gyarmathy 2020). Of these, smart home devices are seeing the fastest growth due to their ability to make life more automated and convenient. For instance, smart speaker devices like Amazon Echo are in over 30 percent of US households that have a broadband connection as of March 2019 (Gyarmathy 2020).",

The explosive growth and the general lack of regulation and standardization have resulted in millions of devices in homes and offices with privacy and security issues. Moreover, people are attracted by the futuristic features that would make their lives more comfortable, and this focus on utility and optimism blinds them to the security and privacy issues. Who would not want to have a baby monitor that can alert them when the baby wakes up, a thermostat that adjusts itself without intervention, or a smart speaker that can switch on lights and other similar devices? People are then alarmed when a widespread cyber-attack occurs, and their data is stolen, or their privacy violated. For instance, the Dyn DDoS attack in 2016 (Greenstein 2019) that disrupted almost the entire Internet was possible due to attackers getting access to thousands of IoT devices, especially smart home devices. Often, the consumers blame the manufacturers for not making the devices secure enough. However, in most instances, the breach happens due to the consumers not resetting the default passwords to access the device. The sharp increase in home deliveries in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to an increase in package thefts (Stickle and Felson 2020). This has led to an increasing number of people purchasing smart home camera systems like the Ring doorbell or Nest camera. At the same time, the smart home camera is one of the most vulnerable devices in the home and was called the  Consumer IoT failure of the year  in 2019 by IoT Analytics (Lueth 2020) due to the sheer number of security breaches with them.",

Therefore, the privacy and security of IoT devices at home are of paramount importance. Manufacturers should acknowledge that most consumers do not know how the smart devices work, are not proficient in updating security settings and have no idea of privacy exposure. Researchers have proposed many solutions to increase awareness as early as the purchase stage. Options like adopting a  nutrition label  on boxes that sell smart devices (Emami-Naeini et al. 2020) or having a standardized privacy fact-sheet similar to what financial organizations in the US have, have been proposed along with many others. While increasing the awareness of consumers is a path that needs to be taken, manufacturers also need to step up to increase the security posture of the devices. It could be as simple as forcing customers to change default passwords. Another mechanism found in many secure web-based systems is to use mutual authentication mutual TLS. The premise of mutual authentication is that only trusted client devices can connect to smart home devices or the network. Two-way authentication is the default mode for protocols like SSH (secure shell). It is, however, optional in TLS (Transport Layer Security). By default, the TLS protocol proves the server s identity to the client using an X. 509 certificate, but the client s identity verification is left to the server. Client-side verification may not be possible for servers that serve a lot of anonymous clients.",

This chapter aims to study authentication mechanisms in smart home systems with a focus on mutual authentication as a solution to improve the security posture of smart home devices. It gives an overview of a smart connected home system, security issues and solutions in smart devices, a primer on mutual TLS, key management practices, mutual authentication in smart home systems and its challenges as well as open research items. 2. 2. Smart home   introduction and technologies 2. 2. 1. Smart home   introduction A smart connected home is a residence set up with IoT devices that help with comfort, convenience, entertainment and security (Aldrich 2003; Mantas et al. 2011) with regard to the people and things within the home. Figure 2. 1 shows some examples of smart home devices. Different terms like smart home, connected home, smart connected home, and so on are used in this context. Originally, smart home  referred to homes that had automated devices within the home, connected home  referred to homes connected over IP-based networks, and  smart connected home  referred to homes that had both of these. However, increasingly these terms are being used interchangeably, and in general, smart home  today refers to  smart connected home. Figure 2. 1. Smart home ecosystem Many aspects of the home that had to be managed manually in the past can now be managed using smart devices.",

    "content": "Figure 2. 1. Smart home ecosystem Many aspects of the home that had to be managed manually in the past can now be managed using smart devices. This is partly due to the advancement of technology that has given rise to miniature devices that can sense and process more data, and also to the development of machine learning techniques to process and understand large amounts of data quickly. In this regard, the smart home is going in the same direction as the smart car, with each new model having more sensors to not only help drive the car but also maintain it. Just a couple of decades ago, there were very few sensors in cars, and now there are hundreds. There are sensors in the tires, cameras all around, sensors on the seats, radars, ultrasonic sensors, vision-based sensors, and so on, giving consumers the ability to enjoy features like blind-spot detection, lane assist, automatic braking, pedestrian warnings, automatic high-beam, voice recognition, voice assistance, and even automatic driving (Möller and Haas 2019). In the same way, there could be smart devices in every corner of the home. Imagine a home that automatically regulates the temperature in each room by learning the usage pattern of the people and pets in the home, a home that detects if the main door or garage door is left open, where the lights, the door, the blinds can be remotely controlled, where voice control can adjust the lights, where the refrigerator tells if is it time for grocery shopping or even does the shopping for the owners, a home that detects water leaks or plumbing issues, a home that warns the residents of fire damage or even an earthquake before it occurs.",

As more sensors are introduced into the home, and as more homes are connected to the Internet, the possibilities are endless. Homeowners can be safer than ever and avoid costly maintenance issues altogether (Ghaffarianhoseini et al. 2016). Routine home maintenance issues like plumbing leaks and non-replacement of air filters cause extensive damage to the home and the HVAC system. Many home buyers find issues in the home that were not discovered during the home inspection process, many unknown even to the previous owners. Having sensors at different parts of the home could avoid many of the hassles of homeownership and make life more enjoyable. Hence the optimism around the connected home technology is well-founded. 2. 2. 2.

Bugeja categorized them into four groups   energy, entertainment, healthcare and security (Bugeja et al. 2018). Mantas et al. grouped them into four categories   home appliances, lighting and climate control system, home entertainment system, home communication system, and home security system (Mantas et al. 2011). Based on the growth in consumer devices commonly available in the market, we could categorize them into the following   security, heating and cooling, lighting, appliances, and entertainment. Some devices overlap multiple categories, and some devices may not fall into any of these groups. For instance, Google Nest Wifi is a wireless router and also doubles up as a smart speaker (Google Assistant) system. As a router, it could not be categorized into any of the categories above, but it could be put under the entertainment category as a smart speaker. Here is a quick overview of these categories: 1) Security   Devices that help protect homes, such as doorbell cameras, smart locks, motion detectors, and alarm systems, fall under this category. Security systems are getting smarter as the usage grows. Some systems can detect when the owner is away from home and automatically lock the home, detect intruders, integrate with smoke or carbon monoxide detectors, or detect water leakages. Nest Protect, the Ring doorbell camera, the Schlage smart lock, Canary Home Security and the Arlo camera are a few examples. 2) Heating and cooling   Keeping the home at an optimal temperature while it is too hot or too cold outside is one of the key elements of making it livable. For a long time, manual thermostats had to be set by people to control the heating system or the air conditioner.",

For a long time, manual thermostats had to be set by people to control the heating system or the air conditioner. Smart thermostats make this automated by learning about the system s usage, saving a lot of energy in the process. The Nest thermostat and Ecobee are examples of such devices. 3) Lighting   Smart lighting systems allow users to control lighting inside or outside the home remotely. Some systems allow lights to be controlled using the voice through smart speakers. Lights could automatically turn on when someone is in the room or gradually turn on during the morning, or even change color based on music or mood. These systems generally need smart bulbs that connect to a central hub. An example of this type of system is the Philips Hue lighting system. 4) Appliances   Refrigerators were one of the first appliances that became popular as a smart appliance. Some refrigerators keep a tab on the inventory of items inside them and notify users (Sripan et al. 2012). Many appliances are now smart devices, such as microwave ovens, dishwashers, and coffee makers.

Most major manufacturers like Sony, Samsung and Vizio have smart entertainment systems. Also, a smart home can be viewed as a system that houses other smart ecosystems. A smart car is a system by itself that connects directly to the Internet. A person wearing implantable and other devices forms a BSN (Body Sensor Network) with its own hub (different from the gateway for the smart home devices) or might connect to a phone, which connects to the Internet. Both the smart car and BSN are in the home though they may not be categorized as smart home systems. 2. 3. Smart home security The mere fact that a smart home system is connected to the Internet means that it is exposed to a hostile environment. Any system that needs to be secure on the Internet should make an effort to address the seven key concepts in the area of computer security (Daswani et al. 2007): 1) Authentication   Authentication is an act of verifying someone s identity using  something you know, something you have, or  something you are, or a combination of these factors. 2) Authorization   Authorization is the act of making sure that a user, generally an authenticated user, has the authority to perform a specific action. 3) Confidentiality   Confidentiality ensures that the data at rest or in transit is kept secret from unauthorized users. 4) Data message integrity   Data integrity ensures that the data is not tampered with during transmission.",

Threats For smart home systems, threats and vulnerabilities can come from any of the seven concepts mentioned above. However, some areas are more critical than others. One key difference between a smart home system and an enterprise system is that the average user of a smart home system may not have in-depth technical knowledge of the system and may not be aware of the threats. A 2014 report published by mashable. com stated that 73, 000 webcams were exposed to the Internet because people had not changed the default passwords (Moh and Raju 2019). There are many such instances where the naivety and ignorance of users has led to security issues. Komninos et al. (2014) listed confidentiality, resilience, reliability and availability as the fundamental security properties that threaten smart home systems. Lin and Bergmann (2016) listed confidentiality, authentication and access as the three critical threats faced by smart home systems. They note the threats to access or authorization as the most severe of these since unauthorized access, especially as an administrator, is potentially catastrophic for the household. Nawir et al.",

Nawir et al. (2016) listed data integrity, privacy, non-repudiation and authorization as the critical threat areas. From the existing literature, we could summarize the following as the key security goals that are compromised by various threats to a smart home system. Threats could be in the form of eavesdropping, traffic analysis, message modification, replay attack, impersonation, repudiation, physical tampering  removal, illegal software update, interception, traffic load, and so on. Data integrity   An adversary could access data in transit and tamper with it, resulting in erroneous measurements and actions. It could be a malicious attacker eavesdropping on traffic from home to an external network or even from the internal network if the attacker has gained access. One way of achieving integrity is MAC (Machine Authentication Code) (Mantas et al. 2011). Data confidentiality   The daily life patterns of residents at home could become exposed due to unauthorized viewing or usage of data from smart home devices. There have been instances of thieves getting to know when residents are at home or not by gaining access to electricity meter readings (Komninos et al. 2014). If attackers can gain access to more data, there is no mention of the harm they could inflict. Confidentiality can be achieved by encrypting data at rest and in flight.",

Authentication   A smart home system has different types of interactions   user-to-device, device-to-device and device-toexternal network (Mantas et al. 2011). Customer impersonation and device impersonation are the chief threats to authentication (Komninos et al. 2014). Weak authentication leads to easy access to the system for adversaries, and this is a considerable threat. The model of authentication at the gateway and free access at the device levels does not work. The best option is to have a Zero Trust security model (Gilman and Barth 2017), assuming that the adversary is inside the internal network, and insist on authentication at every device. However, due to resource constraints, this may not be possible for all devices. Authorization access threats   Unauthorized devices connecting to the home network, unauthorized users gaining administratorlevel access to the smart devices and thereby to other systems in the network, are perilous scenarios. The system should to configured to have different types of users with different access levels so that most users will not have access to resources that they are not authorized for (Mantas et al. 2011). The important thing is to restrict elevated access to a smaller set of users. 2. 3. 2. Vulnerabilities Many researchers have categorized vulnerabilities in smart home systems.

    "content": "Vulnerabilities Many researchers have categorized vulnerabilities in smart home systems. The following are a few of them. Lin and Bergmann (2016) listed the following vulnerabilities for a smart home system   network accessibility, physical accessibility, constrained system resources, system heterogeneity, fixed firmware, slow uptake of standards, and lack of dedicated security professionals to manage the complexities of a smart home network. Many issues like constrained system resources, system heterogeneity, fixed firmware, and slow uptake of standards have been there and are becoming more of an issue due to the increased adoption. Though miniature sensing devices are becoming more powerful with every passing year, they still do not have the computing capabilities to leverage more robust security paradigms. Also, the existence of multiple vendors in the market creates a heterogeneous system with different operating systems and interfaces. Ali and Awad (2018) applied the OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) Allegro methodology to assess the security risks of smart homes. They listed ten different areas of vulnerability with threats for each of the areas. User credentials, device information and metadata, log information, video feed, system setup information, location tracking, and so on are the areas that lead to user impersonation threats, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, information modification, and spying. Davis et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive review of the known vulnerability studies of smart home devices. They classified the vulnerabilities into four categories   physical, network, software and encryption. Physical attacks occur when adversaries gain physical access to devices and tamper with them. The network is vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle and DoS. Software attacks exploit the bugs in the software, especially in systems that have not been patched.",

    "content": "The network is vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle and DoS. Software attacks exploit the bugs in the software, especially in systems that have not been patched. Encryption attacks occur when an attacker breaks the encryption mechanism by gaining access to the keys or using machines powerful enough to crack a weakly encrypted system or data. There are common themes in all these vulnerability areas. Attackers are always on the lookout to hijack a device in the network to steal data or an identity or cause a DoS attack. Also, in most homes, smart devices are not integrated when the home is built. They are gradually added one by one, as and when new systems come onto the market or when the residents in the house become aware of or are able to afford these devices. As mentioned above, devices could be from different manufacturers who may have different standards when it comes to security. Even if a home is secure at a point in time, when a new device is added, the system must be re-evaluated to ensure that the initial assumptions about security have been maintained. The hope is that, as newer systems begin to roll out features like security and privacy labels (Emami-Naeini et al. 2020), consumers will be able to make informed decisions.

IoT communication protocols IoT devices are connected to the Internet but may not always leverage the protocols used by web applications and other devices on the Internet. The main challenge has been that IoT devices are low energy, limited-memory devices and are not as powerful as the general desktop and laptop computers. IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) has established lightweight communication protocols at different layers over the past few years to overcome these limitations. Some of the most commonly used protocols are 6LoWPAN at the physical layer, RPL at the routing layer, and CoAP at the application layer. Here is a short explanation of these three protocols: 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks)   The IEEE wireless standard 802. 15. 4 defines how the physical and MAC layers should operate under low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). 6LoWPAN was designed by IEFT and defined in RFC 4944 (Montenegro et al.",

RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)   RPL is a routing protocol designed by IETF and defined in RFC 6550 (Winter et al. 2012) for wireless networks with low power and in a lossy network. It is a protocol based on distance vectors and is mainly used in 6LoWPAN networks. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)   CoAP is an application layer protocol designed by IETF and defined in RFC 7252 (Shelby et al. 2014) for networks of constrained devices. It provides multi-cast support and adopts UDP (User Datagram Protocol) since it is better suited for low-bandwidth connections than TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) used in web-based communications. The communication is also based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) model, making data exchange semantics simple. CoAP uses DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for secure communications. DTLS is a variant of TLS (Transport Layer Security), used for secure communication over HTTP in web applications. DTLS is based on UDP, while TLS is based on TCP since the implementation of TLS is complicated for constrained devices. Figure 2. 2.

Topology optimization concentrated on metrics like buffer occupancy, MAC reliability, residual energy, expected lifetime, and average delay. Security focused on attacks like DoS, isolation, replay attacks and spoofing.

The authentication mechanism could be of two broad types   intradomain (within-network authentication) and inter-domain (outsidenetwork authentication). Intra-domain authentication could be done by any one of the above mechanisms   proof by knowledge, proof by possession, or proof by property (Mantas et al. 2011). Inter-domain authentication should ideally involve additional factors, say, a combination of proof by knowledge and proof by possession, but that is not the case many times. The ID-password-based authentication mechanism, where authentication is based on a password provided by the user, has to date been the most widely used proof of identity and has not served very well. To reduce friction during onboarding, most manufacturers supply devices with factory-default passwords that remain unchanged by the user. A 2015 study of 50 smart home devices found that none of the devices enforced strong passwords or used other mechanisms to make the devices more secure (Barcena and Wueest 2015). Thus, IoT devices have become the weak link in many systems, and analyses of major breaches have pointed to bad actors leveraging this vulnerability in the past decade. Many home networks that were previously secure have become insecure just by adding a device like a security camera to their network.",

    "content": "Many home networks that were previously secure have become insecure just by adding a device like a security camera to their network. Since password guessing is the leading cause of security breaches due to people using default passwords or weak passwords, employing stricter password requirements is often the first step towards improved smart home systems security. However, that may not be enough since adversaries could obtain passwords through phishing or other mechanisms. Hence, to make the system more secure, it is essential to choose not only a strong password but also use additional factors of authentication. For access patterns where a person is physically present, some biometric factors could be used. However, for remote access of the smart devices through APIs (Application Platform Interfaces), that may not work. 2. 4. 1. Stages of defining an authentication protocol for IoT Ferrag et al. defined different stages that an IoT system provider should go through to realize an authentication protocol. The first step is to define a network model, which could be IoS (Internet of Sensors) in the case of a smart home system. The second step is to define an authentication model that could be any of the authentication mechanisms. Examples are password-based authentication, smartcardbased authentication, biometric authentication, mutual authentication, and RFID authentication. The third step is to define an attack model that is most relevant to the network model. Examples include replay attack, privileged-insider attack, and impersonation attack. The fourth step is to select a list of countermeasures.",

Based on the security requirements at different levels, a specific scheme that suits the requirement or a combination of different schemes is chosen. The following table summarizes different types of authentications grouped by authentication factors and types. Mutual authentication or two-way authentication is one of the authentication procedures mentioned above. In this, both entities involved in communication authenticate each other, thus making sure that anonymous users will not be able to read or modify the state of a device. Mutual authentication can be implemented in many ways   through a shared secret, through public keys, or using a timestamp. Table 2. 5. IoT authentication schemes (El-Hajj et al. 2019) Authentication Scheme Type Description Authentication factor Identity Information presented by the client to identify itself. E. g. password-based authentication. Context Context could be physical or behavioral. Biometric authentication is an example of physical context. Authentication based on keystroke analysis or gait analysis are examples of using behavioral context. Use of tokens Token-based Authentication based on a token generated by the server using schemes like OAuth2 protocol or open ID. Non-token based Re-authentication for every call.

The next section discusses mutual authentication using PKI and key management fundamentals in detail. 2. 5. A primer on mutual authentication and key management terminologies During the Internet s explosive growth phase, one of the main concerns was the secure transport of data, especially sensitive financial data like credit card numbers. One of the first widely used solutions to the problems of data tampering or eavesdropping was SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), developed by Netscape, which was later the basis for the TLS (Transport Layer Security) standard (Dierks and Rescorla 2006) defined by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). TLS 1. 2 was defined later by the IETF in RFC 5246 (Dierks and Rescorla 2008), and the current version is TLS 1. 3 defined in RFC 8446 (Rescorla 2018). TLS is a general-purpose protocol that sits between the application layer (HTTP) and transport layer (TCP), and this automatically ensures that the features of TCP like reliability, flow control, and congestion control are available to the application (Shinzaki et al. 2016). At a high level, an application that TLS secures has three properties that may be used independently or in combination: 1) Client can authenticate the server using public-key cryptography. 2) The connection between the client and server is secure and reliable because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the communication and each message includes a message integrity check.",

In general, TLS usage in the web involves authenticating the server and communicating securely. In mutual authentication, also known as twoway authentication, both steps 1 and 3 listed above occur. The client and server authenticate each other before actual communication occurs by providing digital certificates to prove their identities. 2. 5. 1. X. 509 certificate X. 509 is a specification standard for public-key certificates. It contains a public key and an identity and is either signed by a CA (Certificate Authority) or is self-signed. The mutual authentication process generally involves the following certificates: Root CA certificate   A self-signed X. 509 certificate used to identify a CA that signed a client s certificate. In IoT setup, the administrators deploy a root CA certificate or chain to the edge servers. Server SSL certificate   Deployed in the server and server sends it over to the client during TLS handshake. Client SSL certificate   Deployed in the client and client sends it over to the server during mutual authentication. Many industrial IoT trust implementations use the X. 509 digital certificate format (Russel and Van Duren 2018). In the new IoT devices, the device manufacturer certifies and signs the keys they assign to the devices. The fields in an X. 509 Certificate are as follows: Version.

CoAP and DTLS As mentioned earlier, CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is an application layer protocol defined in RFC 7252 (Shelby et al. 2014) for networks of constrained devices. It can integrate with HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for communication via the web and relies on the request response paradigm using REST (Representational State Transfer). For security, CoAP uses the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) protocol (Rescorla and Modadugu 2012). DTLS is a variant of TLS (Transport Layer Security), used for secure communication over HTTP in web applications. DTLS is based on UDP, while TLS is based on TCP since the implementation of TLS is complicated for constrained devices. The endpoint is of the form coaps: url  for secure communication in lieu of coap: url. Though it is based on UDP, which can have packet losses, DTLS overcomes this by including a sequence number in the message and retransmissions and timeouts. Figure 2. 4. DTLS handshake, client-server authentication Three security modes are available in DTLS: pre-shared key, raw public key, and certificate (Tiloca and Raza 2018). 1) Pre-shared key   In this mode, a set of devices is whitelisted to use a specific set of keys shared ahead of time. 2) Raw public key   In this mode, each device has a pair of asymmetric private-public keys, the identity of each device is computed from the public key, and each device has a list of devices that it can communicate with. 3) Certificate   In this mode, similar to the raw public key mode, each device has a pair of asymmetric private-public keys. The difference is that each device also contains an X. 509 certificate, which has a digital signature from a well-known trust root (Tiloca and Raza 2018).

Flight 3   Client sends ClientHello message to the server with the cookie from HelloVerifyRequest attached. Flight 4   Flight 6   The server responds with ServerHello, and its certificate and client and server authenticate each other, establish mutual trust, and are ready to communicate securely. 2. 5. 3. TLS 1. 3 TLS 1. 3 (Rescorla 2018) was introduced with IoT use-cases in mind, i. e. to secure connections to and between low-capability devices. One of the main goals was the reduction of n-RTT (number of round trip time) required for the handshake. TLS 1. 3 requires only one round trip for a full handshake in comparison to 2-RTT for TLS 1. 2. This cuts the encryption latency in half. This is done by sending the key agreement algorithm the server might use and the KeyShare in the ClientHello. If the server is ok with that, it sends back its KeyShare for the same algorithm, thus completing the handshake. Also, the ServerConfiguration packet is introduced, which enables remembering previous connections, and this reduces it to 0-RTT for future connections. Most certificates use the RSA algorithm, but lightweight schemes use ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), which uses smaller keys with the same security level as RSA. Figure 2. 5.

The lifecycle could include generating, storing, transporting, protecting and revoking keys. A good security practice is to use one type of key for one purpose (Daswani et al. 2007). Keys used for authentication are generally called  identity keys. Other types of keys are  session transport keys  used for communication between two entities using TLS IPSec, and  integrity keys  used to compute MACs (message authentication codes) for performing integrity checks on IoT messages. Key generation Key generation refers to using the mechanism in which keys are generated. Depending on the type of the algorithm and the usage, the key generation scheme might be different. The key generation method for symmetric algorithms is different from that of asymmetric algorithms, where public private pair of keys need to be generated. One must be careful not to generate weak keys that could be exploited. General rules of thumb are to carefully choose the random number generation algorithm, use passwords and salts to generate a key, not reinvent the wheel and utilize tried-and-tested utilities and libraries to generate keys. Key generation can be performed directly on the machine or in a centralized key management system. One aspect to remember is to be careful with the location of the key generation. It is safer to generate keys in a machine that is not connected to a network and temporarily store them in a place that is not shared and wipe the memory once the key generation is completed (Daswani et al. 2007). Key storage Key storage refers to the process of securely storing keys. Keys themselves can be encrypted using KEKs (key encryption keys).",

Though different systems use varied key storage methods like storing parts of the keys at different places in the code, storing on the disk, storing on a PDA, or a smart card, the safest mechanism is to store in an HSM (hardware security module). HSMs are cryptographic modules that provide extensive physical and logical security protections and are specifically designed to be very difficult to hack (Russel and Van Duren 2018). If hacked or tampered with, they automatically wipe the data stored within. Key agreement and transport Key agreement refers to the process of two parties agreeing to use a shared symmetric key or agree upon a scheme of using a pair of public private keys to communicate. When A needs to send a message to B, A either encrypts the message with B s public key or a randomly generated key using the public key. B then decrypts the message using its private key. Key transport refers to the process of sending a cryptographic key from one party to another. The key is generally encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK), which may be symmetric or asymmetric. Key revocation Sometimes keys could be compromised and in that scenario they will have to be revoked or deleted. Securely deleting cryptographic keys from memory is called zeroization, in which the memory location is overwritten with zeros or random data instead of just deleting the key. The key deletion could also involve physical destruction of the hard drives so that it does not fall into the wrong hands.",

The key deletion could also involve physical destruction of the hard drives so that it does not fall into the wrong hands. Other concepts related to key management that one must be aware of are  key escrow, where keys are stored securely with a third party to be prepared for a disaster recovery scenario, key lifetime, which refers to how long a key should be in use, key accounting  which refers to tracking the usage of a key during its lifetime. 2. 6. Mutual authentication in smart home systems Figure 2. 6. High level overview of a smart home system Figure 2. 6 shows a smart home network consisting of various communication channels between devices in the home. Though the figure shows a single gateway connecting all the devices, there could be multiple in reality. There could be one gateway for all the bulbs in the home, and another for the security sensors since they are from different manufacturers. Devices like smart speakers could connect to a smartphone through Bluetooth. For the sake of simplicity, we could consider a gateway connecting to all the devices and a smartphone being able to connect to these devices through the gateway.",

Moreover, as per our earlier review of security architectures, gateway architecture was the most preferred option. The gateway can provide the translation between varied IoT standards, help maintain a common security scheme and connect the devices to the Internet. The gateway acts as a bridge between the smart home devices and the user. The user can connect to any of the smart home devices from anywhere in the world if they can connect to the gateway through the Internet. Mutual authentication during the initiation phase can be described as follows. When a new device is added to a system that has a gateway, authentication happens during the first pairing. At this stage, a certificate is created, issued and verified with a manufacturer s private key (Kang et al. 2017). Once the pairing process is completed, the  authentication module  returns the module Id and relevant values to indicate whether the new connection is permitted or not. The user registers themselves with the trusted registration authority. The devices are already registered with a trusted authority. Thus, the gateway acts as the special node responsible for controlling the network data, device and network interoperability, and secure management.",

After successful and secure registration, the trusted authority stores this information in the memory of the smartphone and the gateway used during the authentication process. Three categories of mutual authentication occur: a) between the user and the gateway, b) between the gateway and the smart devices, c) between the user and the smart devices. In addition, they establish a secret session key between them to protect exchanged messages. A symmetric session key is established for future secure communications using a symmetric cipher such as AES-CBC. 2. 6. 1. Device and user onboarding The first step in device onboarding is device provisioning, which is the process of a device registering itself to the IoT platform when it first comes online. The process is as follows: At the manufacturer   Using the root CA registered to the platform, a certificate that is unique to the device is created. This is then stored in the device firmware. At the user   When the device comes online and connects to the platform, the platform validates the certificate against its root CA. After this, the device can connect multiple times to the platform. The next step is device onboarding, which is the process of linking a user identity to a device. The process is as follows: the user gets an activation code from the device (it could be on the device or on the packaging from the manufacturer, provided through the phone, etc. ); the user submits the code to the platform, and it associates the user with the device and sends this information to the gateway or the device.

Flow of user authentication and authorization When a device is trying to get access to a sensor through the gateway, it gets authenticated first. Key exchanges occur, and credentials are validated by the gateway or, in some instances, the remote server. When the authentication is complete, the platform generates a session id to keep track of all the actions during that specific session. After authentication is completed, the gateway checks the ACLs for authorization when the user performs any action. ACLs are checked to make sure that the user is authorized to perform that specific action. 2. 6. 3. Examples of mutual authentication schemes There have been many designs and implementations of the usage of mutual authentication in a smart home ecosystem. Over a decade ago, SPS (Secure Profile Server) was proposed, which had the inter-node communication as TLS enabled, and provided payload encryption and certificate-based authentication based on X. 509 certificates. SPS was a middleware for smart home systems to ensure the security of personal profiles by allowing access only for relevant stakeholders in a specific situation. Mutual authentication was made mandatory to prevent anyone from spoofing their identity to the Security Manager, and it used a ticketing system. A ticket comprises the six entries   a) Application s identifier, b) Application s public key, c) Issuer s public key, d) ACL (Access Control List), e) Timestamp with expiry, and f) Digital Signature.

Fouda et al. proposed a mutual authentication and a lightweight message authentication mechanism for smart grids (Fouda et al. 2011). This system had less communication overhead and message decryption delay than other systems of the day (Ferrag et al. 2017). Nicanfar et al. proposed SGMA (Smart Grid Mutual Authentication protocol) and SGKM (Smart Grid Key Management) (Nicanfar et al. 2013) in which the smart meter in a home network was mutually authenticated with an authentication server in the smart grid. The protocol used an initial password and provided efficiency by decreasing the number of steps in the remote password protocol from five to three, and the number of exchanged packets from four to three. The mutual authentication scheme prevented brute-force attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and DoS attacks. The proposal also contained an efficient key management protocol for key management of unicast and multicast communications in the smart grid based on enhanced identity-based cryptography using the PKI (Ferrag et al. 2017). Other examples are the ECC-based authenticated key establishment (EAKE) protocol proposed by Li (Li 2013), another ECC-based device authentication protocol for smart energy home area networks by Vaidya (Vaidya et al.",

There are also many examples of mutual authentication for machine-tomachine (M2M) communications. The LGTH (Lightweight Group authentication protocol) (Lai et al. 2013) implemented mutual authentication for M2M communications. To reduce the authentication overhead of the public-key cryptosystems, LGTH proposed a lightweight group authentication protocol based on aggregate message authentication codes (MACs) (Lai et al. 2013a, 2013b). The SE-AKA (secure and efficient authentication and key agreement) protocol (Lai et al. 2013a, 2013b) proposed implementing mutual authentication between devices in a home network domain, among others. The protocol was an enhancement over the existing AKA protocols with lower authentication message delivery overhead (Ferrag et al. 2017). It used elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to realize key forward key backward secrecy. It used the ProVerif tool, an automatic cryptographic protocol verifier, for security analysis and formal verification of the mutual authentication between the mobile equipment and its serving network (Ferrag et al. 2017).

This protocol proposed the implementation of mutual authentication and key agreement between a group of devices that perform M2M (machine-to-machine) communication within 3GPP and WiMAX networks. The M2M application model using TDSCDMA (time division-synchronous code division multiple access) (Sun et al. 2015) achieved mutual authentication in machine-to-machine home network communication by connecting a mobile user with the home network using the TDSCDMA network. After connection, the communicating parties were identified by password-based authentication and key establishment protocol. It was efficient in terms of the number of calculations needed and communication volume (Ferrag et al. 2017). GLARM (group-based lightweight authentication scheme for resource-constrained M2M communications) (Lai et al. 2016) focused on group authentication and key agreement but for M2M devices in 3GPP networks. Here the mutual authentication and secure key agreement happened in the initialization and group authentication and key agreement phases. There are also many mutual authentication schemes focused on WSNs, which are a broader class of sensors that include smart home sensors. PAWN (payloadbased mutual authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks) (Jan et al. 2017) is one such example. This scheme proposed an extremely lightweight payload-based mutual authentication protocol for a cluster-based hierarchical WSN. It operated in two steps. In the first step, an optimal percentage of cluster heads was selected, authenticated, and allowed to communicate with neighboring nodes. In the second step, each cluster head acted as a server and authenticated nearby nodes to form clusters. PAWN could detect Sybil attacks based on the cluster formation between neighboring nodes and their nearest cluster head (Ferrag et al. 2017). Kumari et al.",

It used BAN-Logic to verify that the proposed protocol could establish a session key between user and sensor node (Ferrag et al. 2017). Similar proposals that provided mutual authentication and session key agreement securely for WSNs used tools like BAN-logic (Chung et al. 2016), ProVerif (Mahmood et al. 2016), and AVISPA (Amin and Biswas 2016) security analyzer for verification. The improved three-factor remote authentication scheme for WSN (Wu et al. 2018) used mutual authentication to protect data between the sensor node, users, and gateway node. This scheme was an improvement over an earlier three-factor authentication scheme (Das et al. 2016), which lacked user anonymity and strong forward security. Many mutual authentication schemes have been proposed for systems with smart card-based authentication, along with additional features like perfect forward secrecy (Chang and Le 2015), anonymity, untraceability (Jiang et al. 2016), and authentication using biohashing (Srinivas et al. 2017).

In 2016, a team from Fujitsu Laboratories published a paper that outlined a lightweight mutual authentication mechanism. It evaluated two variants of the TLS protocol, named TLS-PSK and TLS-DHE-RSA. TLS-PSK used pre-shared keys (PSK), while TLS-DHE-RSA used public-key cryptographic methods. The downside of using public-key cryptography was that it required all the devices to have a certificate, which had a considerable effort estimate. In order to overcome this difficulty, Fujitsu proposed a public-key cryptography technology called ID-based cryptography. The proposal allowed the use of information (ID) associated with a user, device or server, such as a device ID, e-mail address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), as a public key. The proposal by Amin et al. contained an architecture applicable for a distributed cloud environment using a smart card. It was based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and provided mutual authentication between registered users and IoT devices (Amin et al. 2018). Considering the low capacity of the devices, many authentication schemes use symmetric key cryptography. Several lightweight authentication protocols have been proposed to solve this issue. The anonymous authentication scheme by Banerjee et al. is an authentication protocol that used one-way hashing and XOR functions to make the protocol lightweight (Banerjee et al. 2020). This was an improvement over the ECC-based anonymous authentication protocol by Shuai et al. (2019).",

It is a nascent field, and there are many players in the market, leading to fragmentation and devices that have different standards and use differing protocols. Another issue of being an emerging technology is that companies compete to be the pioneers in a sector and give much importance to time-to-market. Devices are being made with futuristic features and secured with solutions to existing security and privacy challenges, which means that the industry is continuously in a catch-up mode. To summarize, here are the key areas where more research focus is needed: 1) Smartness in routers and modems that connect smart home devices to the Internet   Many security solutions for smart home devices are in gateways hubs that cater to devices of specific companies. For example, Philips Hue bulbs connect to a Philips Hub, which connects to the Internet through a wired connection to the router, while the Ring doorbell connects to the Internet through a wireless connection to the router. An intrusion detection system could be a feature in the Philips Hub or similar gateways but not in the home router or modem. Hence the possibility of a universal router that could perform the function of a hub by plugging in a software module could make things more secure for the user. At the same time, the consumer may not have to deal with the complexity of multiple hubs.

    "content": "4 devices without using a gateway  (Yin et al. 2015) will benefit customers immensely. 2) Auto configuration support   As mentioned before, a lack of technical knowledge and support is one of the biggest challenges. Consumers are burdened by error-prone manual steps to add and manage smart devices (Lin and Bergmann, 2016) and mostly leave default settings as-is to get things done fast, which opens the door to security issues. Hence research into secure auto-configuration will make smart home device installations much more straightforward and improve the security posture (Lin and Bergmann 2016). 3) Standardization of device upgrades   IoT devices generally do not get the security patches and operating system upgrades that desktop or mobile devices get (Lin and Bergmann 2016). There are many reasons for this. There are too many devices, the heterogeneity of versions is vast, many devices need software and firmware upgrades, and so on. Research into the standardization of devices, interfaces, and easier updates would be beneficial. 4) Built-in security and privacy goals during design   There should be guidelines for manufacturers of devices to incorporate security into smart devices in the design phase or earlier. The goal should be to design systems that mitigate automated attack risks, where integration points are secure, protect confidentiality and privacy, have availability and redundancy built-in, are resilient, and are compliant (Russel and Van Duren 2018). Research into this area would help in standardization, reduce heterogeneity, and remove problems at the root. 5) Bring regulation to the industry   Due to the lack of standardization and regulation, the consumer is not fully aware of the amount of data being collected or shared by smart devices. Ideas like adopting a  nutrition label  on boxes that sell smart devices (Emami-Naeini et al. 2020) are great.",

Those will bring the much-needed transparency and force the manufacturers to factor in privacy and security. Research on the types of labels and their usefulness is one of the most critical areas that need focus. 6) Improved awareness and knowledge among common people   It is time to treat smart home devices as public utility tools similar to smart meters. Utility companies run paid ads to promote devices like smart meters. In the same way, different manufacturers or governments need to run influencer campaigns or publish educational material in social media about the security and privacy aspects of smart home devices. Research in the area of correlating  improvement of tech-savviness of consumers  to  reduction in cyberattacks on Smart Home devices  would be beneficial for policymakers and companies in the industry. 2. 8. Conclusion In this chapter, we focused on security issues within IoT devices in a smart home environment. We also reviewed the security threats and vulnerabilities, the communication protocols generally used in smart home systems highlighting protocols like 6LoWPAN, RPL, and CoAP as well as their variants. We then reviewed key security architectures for IoT systems listing out middlewares, cloud-based, and gateway solutions. These reviews set the context to perform a deep dive into one of the mechanisms for securing smart home devices   mutual authentication. Before going into mutual authentication for smart homes, we reviewed the basics of mutual authentication with TLS and the practices involved in security key management. We then reviewed mutual TLS and mutual DTLS for IoT.",

    "content": "Before going into mutual authentication for smart homes, we reviewed the basics of mutual authentication with TLS and the practices involved in security key management. We then reviewed mutual TLS and mutual DTLS for IoT. We concluded that mutual TLS offers several security advantages both for user-to-machine communication as well as machine-to-machine communications. In particular, mutual TLS authentication protects against credential theft through phishing; it also protects against brute force attacks on passwords, man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS attacks, and many others. In addition, client certificates provide a clear chain of trust. We then reviewed over 20 mutual authentication systems from over the past decade such as SPS (secure profile server), LGTH (lightweight group authentication protocol), SE-AKA (secure and efficient authentication and key agreement protocol), SEGR (secure and efficient group roaming protocol), SGMA (smart grid mutual authentication protocol), GLARM (group-based lightweight authentication scheme for resource-constrained M2M communications), PAWN (payload-based mutual authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks) and so on. Many of these were mutual authentication for machine-to-machine communications. Rightfully so, since machine identities have far outpaced human identities in the IoT era. After that, we reviewed protocols and architectures for mutual authentication in different areas like SG-HAN (smart grids), WSN focused mechanisms, card-based authentication, methods used in distributed cloud computing, and also many lightweight protocols. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and different solutions would be apt in different situations. The seven stages of identifying an authentication protocol defined by Ferrag et al. (Ferrag et al. 2017) can be used as a baseline to ask the right questions and narrow them down to specific schemes.",

To ensure security of IoT smart homes, it has been suggested that silicon-based physically unclonable functions (PUF) be incorporated in the IoT devices themselves. PUFs are used as the main technique for establishing device authentication and secure key exchange as well as any higher level security protocols. This chapter provides an analysis of the characteristics and performance of SRAM physically unclonable functions. The analysis takes into account several factors such as the static or slowly-varying random process variations as well as the dynamic CMOS noise sources. The main parameters affecting the performance are identified and techniques used to measure them at the fabricator and in the field are explained. Three algorithms are proposed for choosing the set of challenges and the corresponding responses.",

    "content": "Three algorithms are proposed for choosing the set of challenges and the corresponding responses. The three algorithms are: Algorithm  1: single challenge; Algorithm  2: repeated challenge; and Algorithm  3: repeated challenge with bit selection. The last algorithm manages to eliminate the bit errors in the response and hence will not require the use of error correction coding often used in secure sketch or fuzzy extractor methods that have previously been proposed. The use of physically unclonable functions, coupled with the proposed algorithms, provide a layer of protection against the common IoT attacks and the novel deep learning attacks that EW claimed to be a serious security threat to IoT devices in telehealth applications. 3. 1. Introduction An emerging application of smart homes is telehealth, where healthcare delivery is extended to serve stay-at-home patients and remote or isolated communities. Telehealth is motivated by the escalating healthcare costs and the fact that many patients can not afford longterm hospital stays and prefer staying in their homes or within their remote communities. Telehealth relies very heavily on equipping the home with smart IoT devices that can sense the patient s vitals and can also deliver medication in a secure environment that is immune to cyber attacks. This approach allows us to reach out to many disadvantaged communities, thereby democratizing healthcare, as well as leading to reduced costs and speedy patient recovery times (Ellenbecker et al. 2008; National Institute on Aging 2020). IoT devices used in smart homes are considered the weakest link in the security protocols implemented. As a result, contemplating the implementation of critical telehealth services in a smart home is very risky due to the device limitations of the Internet of Things (IoT).",

    "content": "As a result, contemplating the implementation of critical telehealth services in a smart home is very risky due to the device limitations of the Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the limitations include: 1) Limited resources, such as computer processing capabilities, which often prevent the implementation of secure key exchange algorithms that use complex elliptic functions. 2) Storing secret keys in non-volatile memory (NVRAM) is considered a security gap since simple memory attacks can reveal those secret keys. Furthermore, these secret keys are are hard to update since the NVRAM must be reprogrammed. 3) Users often do not customize or update each IoT device password or operating system firmware and rely solely on factoryset defaults. This is what system attackers first look for to launch their attacks. 4) IoT devices are located in unsecured premises and can be subject to theft, counterfeiting and reverse engineering. These limitations impact the effectiveness of security protocols for both authentication and secure key exchange. A very promising technique for endowing a simple IoT device with a unique identity and the ability to secure secret keys without using NVRAM is to use silicon-based physically unclonable functions (PUF). There are many types of PUFs based on different physical phenomena such as optical, acoustical and electrical. However only silicon PUFs implemented as electric circuits are practical for inexpensive implementations on simple IoT devices. Silicon PUFs are practical means of adding unique, unclonable identities to IoT devices. This is equivalent to biometrics in humans, such as iris, retina, voice, facial or fingerprint. PUFs not only help to authenticate IoT devices, but also aid in storing secret keys in the way a PUF is constructed. Traditionally, secret keys are stored in IoT devices using NVRAM.",

    "content": "PUFs not only help to authenticate IoT devices, but also aid in storing secret keys in the way a PUF is constructed. Traditionally, secret keys are stored in IoT devices using NVRAM. The disadvantage of NVRAM is the ability of an attacker to extract the secret keys, using many techniques such as memory persistence, reverse engineering, etc. A very attractive property of PUFs is their tamper-resistance which provides immunity from reverse engineering attacks that aim to extract the unique device response. The unique response of the PUF prevents the manufacturer, the user and the attacker from duplicating the PUF function, even when the PUF hardware design and structure are known. Authentication using PUFs is based on establishing a challengeresponse pair (CRP) where a set of challenges and their associated unique response is established by the device manufacturer. This dataset is then shared with a trusted certification authority (CA) for later use by administrators of the telehealth system to construct a secure and trusted system. There are several criteria for CRP establishment: 1) Several CRP must be established so that each CRP is used only once to prevent attackers from forging a valid response by observing past CRP activities. 2) The number of bits for each response must be  large enough  to be able to establish enough Hamming distance (HD) separation between valid devices and counterfeit ones. 3) Techniques must be established to remove the inevitable dynamic noise from the PUF response to be able to match the noisy response to the one provided by the manufacturer and stored at a CA. 4) Algorithms must be provided to extract a high-entropy stable and repeatable secret key from a noisy low-entropy response.",

    "content": "4) Algorithms must be provided to extract a high-entropy stable and repeatable secret key from a noisy low-entropy response. The ability to construct inexpensive PUFs for IoT edge devices allows us to impart a unique device identity (ID), which is used for device authentication and developing stable and secure session keys. A very significant advantage is that the session key is obtained at the beginning of each session without the use of NVRAM. The key will be shared between the device and the authenticator through the use of publicly available helper data that will not compromise either the key or the device response. Ensuring security of telehealth systems is hard, since many devices are distributed in insecure locations. Many types of attacks become feasible, such as eavesdropping, theft, tampering, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, etc. Central to ensuring security is authentication and key exchange. Cryptographic protocols are based on primitive operations such as block ciphers, stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. These primitive operations rely on storing a secret key stored in non-volatile memory, which proves to be their Achilles heel, especially for unsecured IoT devices (Delvaux 2017b). The use of PUFs for mutual authentication in IoT devices has been the recognized solution to endowing IoT devices with a unique identity, akin to a fingerprint or retina image for human users. A PUF serves to authenticate a device and also provides a measure of tamper resistance (Gassend et al. 2002; Ravikanth et al. 2002; Guajardo et al. 2007; Suh and Devadas 2007; Maes et al. 2009, 2012; Maes 2013; Herder et al.",

Operation of the PUF relies on a challengeresponse pair (CRP), where the server issues a challenge and the IoT device, or client, provides a response that is unique to the device. The problem with PUF response is it is noisy but has low entropy. Therefore, techniques have been developed to recover reliable and stable response from the noisy response using fuzzy extractors or secure sketch (Linnartz and Tuyls 2003; Boyen 2004; Dodis et al. 2004, 2008). The advantage of the fuzzy extractor is that it also serves to generate a secret key with high entropy from the low-entropy noisy response. Contributions: The contributions of this chapter can be summarized as follows: 1) Novel statistical modeling and analysis of SRAM PUFs is presented. The model includes the effects of static random process variations and dynamic CMOS noise. 2) The main physical, device and system parameters affecting the PUF response are identified and techniques to estimate them are presented for both the IoT device manufacturer and for the IoT device user in the field. 3) A novel NOR-based SRAM PUF cell design is proposed that enables rapid device resetting at a speed matching the operating speed of the system and does not require the waste of too much delay or energy resetting the entire SRAM.",

Organization: The rest of this chapter is structured as follows. In section 3. 2 we discuss the literature related to the use of PUFs for authentication and secure key exchange. In section 3. 3 we review the architecture of a telehealth system where the smart home is the target for the healthcare delivery. In section 3. 4 we discuss physically unclonable functions and using secure sketch and fuzzy extractors to remove the dynamic noise from the PUF response. In section 3. 5 we discuss the use of convolutional coding as a means of generating the helper data without revealing the IoT device response when a challenge is issued. In section 3. 6 the structure of SRAM PUFs is presented and a novel NOR-based SRAM is discussed. A statistical model of the SRAM PUF is also developed. In section 3. 7 we propose three algorithms for issuing the PUF challenge-response pair (CRP) data and their effect on system design. In section 3. 8 we discuss the attacks targeting smart homes, especially deep learning attacks. 3. 2.

    "content": "2. Related literature A high-level authentication and key exchange protocol for a smart home IoT system was recently proposed by Fakroon et al. (2020, 2021). The protocol used a two-factor authentication scheme that preserved user anonymity and untraceability. In the 2020 publication, the IoT edge devices were assumed to have secret keys stored in NVRAM. On the other hand, the 2021 publication assumed the secret keys could be derived from a built-in PUF that gave the IoT edge devices unique IDs. Security analysis of the scheme was conducted through formal analysis using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic (BAN), informal analysis and model check using the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. A review of PUF-based security techniques can be found in Dodis et al. (2004, 2008). The authors discussed how to use a low-entropy PUF response to generate secure keys with high entropy. Secret key extraction techniques used fuzzy extractors to obtain session keys from the noisy PUF responses. PUFs are classified as strong PUFs and weak PUFs as explained by Delvaux et al. (2014) and Delvaux (2017b). The discussion discussed the impact of strong and weak PUFs on device authentication and secure key exchange. A discussion was also provided about the helper data algorithm and how it can be used to obtain high-entropy stable keys from noisy, low-entropy PUF responses. At a different level, the abstraction of PUF operation as a one-way functions can be found in Ravikanth (2001) and Ravikanth et al.",

At a different level, the abstraction of PUF operation as a one-way functions can be found in Ravikanth (2001) and Ravikanth et al. (2002). They compared algorithmic one-way functions (e. g. RSA encryption) with physical oneway functions (e. g. PUFs). A discussion of silicon PUFs can be found in Gassend et al. (2002). The discussion focused mainly on delay-based PUFs such as arbiter PUF and ring oscillator PUF. The authors also discussed helper data, which is used to generate session keys from PUF responses. An initial attempt at analyzing delay-based PUFs can be found in Suh and Devadas (Suh and Devadas 2007). The analysis considered the need to use each CRP only once. Techniques were proposed to generate a sufficiently large number of responses through increasing the number of options to configure the circuit delays. The authors also discussed low-cost authentication techniques that do not require the use of the more expensive cryptographic primitives. It is interesting to explore how PUFs can be incorporated using the popular FPGA technology. This is especially true for SRAM PUFs, which could make use of the built-in block RAM provided in many FPGA modules. However, resetting the SRAM might not be a simple matter, since this was not part of the design requirements of an FPGA block RAM (Xilinx 2021). Guajardo et al.",

(2007) studied SRAM PUF structures implemented in FPGA technology. To overcome noise associated with the response of the PUF a fuzzy extractor was used. This also helped extract secure and stable session keys with high entropy. In a series of publications, Maes et al. (2012, 2009) and Maes (2013) discussed seven silicon-based as well as non-silicon-based PUFs. The authors also discussed the secure sketch techniques used to generate session keys that were proposed by Dodis et al. (2004, 2008). Reviewing the published literature, we can make several conclusions about the current state of the art in using PUFs for IoT authentication and secure exchange: 1) The literature discusses, sometimes implicitly, one algorithm for issuing the CRP pairs: a single challenge is issued and the device response is observed. This is a simple algorithm that does not utilize the IoT device statistical characteristics to its advantage. Perhaps the only advantage of this algorithm is that it maximizes the number of CRP pairs, which is critical, especially for weak PUFs. 2) The parameters that define the response of the IoT PUF device are not identified in most published works. General statements are typically stated such as: a large number of response bits are needed to differentiate valid from counterfeit devices. At best a sketch is provided about the desired Hamming distance (HD) separation between valid devices and counterfeit devices. 3) Values of the PUF circuit parameters, the statistical parameters and the choice of overall system parameters are not studied to see how the response of the PUF can be controlled and optimized.",

Mobile User (M): This can be thought of as the smart devices or telephones used by the healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses.

The main advantages of silicon SRAM PUF are several: 1) Silicon SRAM based on CMOS technology does not require any extra processing steps which makes them practical to implement at no additional costs or delays (Holcomb et al. 2009). 2) The area cost is less than that required by an identity stored in NVRAM since circuits often require extra hardware such as charge pump to program the NVRAM. 3) The identity can not be cloned or reverse-engineered without destroying the fingerprint itself and removing the possibility of any device recyling. 4) The number of CRP goes beyond the number of words of the memory. In fact, the number of challenge-response pairs (CRP) is given by equation  3. 6  or equation  3. 7  later in this chapter. In addition, a PUF provides tamper resistance since any changes to the device physical parameters will lead to a corrupted identity (Maes et al. 2009). The concept of silicon PUF was first proposed by Gassend et al. (2002). Silicon PUF operation relies on the inevitable random variations that are introduced during the fabrication of semiconductor devices. This gives the means to uniquely identify the individual devices. Furthermore, such a PUF can not be replicated through reverse engineering even by the device manufacturer. SRAM cells provide an compact way to create a silicon PUF through the unique startup values of the individual words in the memory (Guajardo et al. 2007; Boehm and Hofer 2009; Schrijen 2020).",

Some implementations were done in FPGA platforms (Herrewege et al. 2012; Maes et al. 2012) and some were implemented on microcontrollers (Aysu et al. 2015). Gao et al. (2019) proposed an SRAM-based PUF key generator on a microcontroller using RF energy harvesting. 3. 5. Convolutional encoding and Viterbi decoding the SRAM words As explained in section 3. 4. 1, the PUF response is inherently noisy due to the CMOS dynamic noise. Means have to be provided for removing this noise from the response. This is the job of the secure sketch which is derived from forward error correcting coding (FEC) theory. The helper data w in Figure 3. 2 is used to remove the dynamic noise. However, the system designer must ensure that w does not reveal any information about the device response since w will be sent across unsecured channels. Furthermore, the error correcting capability of the  3. 2  secure sketch must be limited to a certain number of bit errors. If it exceeds that limit, there is a danger of inadvertently converting the response from a counterfeit device to that of a valid device.",

If it exceeds that limit, there is a danger of inadvertently converting the response from a counterfeit device to that of a valid device. Convolutional codes are a powerful FEC technique that is the only FEC that can handle both random errors and bust errors. The error correcting capability can be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the code rate, respectively. A rate k n convolutional encoder accepts k message bits and adds redundant bits to produce n output bits for each message with n   k. A convolutional encoder is specified by the three-tuple (n, k, m) where: 1) n: number of bits of the message after encoding; 2) k: number of information bits of the message before encoding; 3) m: order of the code or number of storage registers. The code rate is defined by the first two parameters k n. We can write the convolutional encoder as where x n  is the k-bit input symbol, yi n  is the ith k-bit output symbol with 0   i   n, and hi j  is the k-bit generator polynomial weight with 0   j   m the number of delay elements. x n  represents the input symbol stream and y n  represents the output symbol stream. Figure 3. 4 shows a 1 2 convolutional encoder. The disadvantage of the structure in Figure 3. 4 is the delay incurred to add m inputs using XOR gates. The constraint length for the k n encoder with the structure in Figure 3. 4 is km, which indicates the number of delay elements needed to generate the outputs from k inputs.

These criteria will determine which bits of a given SRAM word are to be used for encoding decoding and which ones will be overpassed according to the algorithms discussed in section 3. 7. The manufacturer applies convolutional coding to the golden SRAM data word before transmission. The ICs in the field use Viterbi decoding on the actual PUF output to generate the corrected SRAM word. The decoder uses hard decision algorithm, where each bit is interpreted as either  0  or  1. 3. 6. CMOS SRAM PUF construction The basic structure of an SRAM CMOS cell is shown in Figure 3. 6, which is basically two cross-coupled CMOS inverters. An excellent discussion of the operation of the CMOS SRAM memory is found in (Prince 1991, section 5. 5). As we shall see in section 3. 6. 2, part of the requirement for an SRAM PUF is to perform repeated resetting of the SRAM. An SRAM PUF might have to be reset over 1, 000 or more times to obtain a dependable response free of dynamic noise. This is a basic feature of the proposed algorithm discussed in sections 3. 7. 2 and 3. 7. 3 later in this chapter. The basic SRAM can be reset in one of two ways 1) Disconnect then reconnect the power supply VDD. This will force the initial state of the two outputs of the cell to be 0 simultaneously. However, this is a slow process since the power supply rails usually have very large parasitic capacitances. 2) Ground the bit lines and set the word line W   1. This will ensure the initial state of the two outputs of the cell to be 0 simultaneously. This option requires modifying the word lines W and for the entire SRAM module.",

Detail of the basic cell structure for NOR gate-based SRAM PUF The cell structure in Figure 3. 8 was first simulated using the analog device simulator QUCS (Jahn and Borrás 2007). The simulator confirmed the basic operation of the SRAM cell under normal operation when R   0 and W   1. When the cell was reset (R   1), both outputs B and both reached the same reset value due to symmetry conditions. When the reset was not asserted R   0, the SRAM cell assumed a random value 1 or 0. It should be mentioned that the cell design can use two NOR gates or two inverters. The inverter-based design, also known as the 6transistor design, must add enough pass-gates to allow for breaking up the feedback path and setting the inputs of the two inverters to equal values, whether 0 or 1. There is therefore no saving in terms of the MOS transistor count to using the 6-transistor cell design. Assuming the number of words in the SRAM PUF to be N and that a challenge selects addresses of k words, the number of challengeresponse pairs (CRP) is given by the permutation  3. 6   3. 7  when repetitions are allowed. Alternatively we have when repetitions are not allowed. Adopting this strategy, one can construct strong PUF out of NOR-based SRAM PUF, especially if the order of the response bits is pre-arranged and can be securely varied at the start of each session. 3. 6. 1. SRAM PUF statistical model The operation of SRAM PUF relies to two random physical phenomena: random processing variations and dynamic noise, which are analog processes.

Both these phenomena control the digital binary value of the stored bits after SRAM initialization. Random process variation is static for a given device and facilitates creation of the device  biometric  or unique fignerprint. Random dynamic noise, on the other hand, is dynamic and introduces noise to the device identity (ID). One way to analyze an SRAM-based PUF is to accurately model the devices and wire delays of the basic cell. However, this will not account for all the factors, such as doping variations, oxide thickness variations, random parasitic loading capacitances, etc. Instead we resort here to developing a logical model that encompasses all these physical phenomena. This approach is akin to the logical modeling of faults instead of modeling all possible physical faults in an integrated circuit. The random variable we choose to model should be amenable to measurements under mass production settings by the device manufacturer. In the context of using an SRAM PUF, an appropriate random variable is the content of the SRAM memory cells. This is a binary random variable that is characterized by the two probabilities a and b denoting the probability that the SRAM cell is  1  or  0, respectively. Ideally random process variations and CMOS noise are absent and the structure of each SRAM cell is completely symmetric making the ideal probabilities ai and bi satisfy the equality  3. 8   3.",

The digitization, or analog-to-digital conversion, step gives the golden or reference stored value v(w, b) of each bit in the SRAM PUF where 0   w   W is the SRAM row index or word address and 0   b   B is the bit index within a word. The assignment of golden or reference memory content is given by the rules: The conditions in equation  3. 18  indicate the cell is skewed toward 0 or 1, respectively, and the effect of dynamic noise is negligible. Such cells provide the desired randomness that make the PUF hard to clone or reverse engineer (Holcomb et al. 2009). The manufacturer now prepares a dataset for each device s SRAM PUF. The dataset contains the following information: 3. 19   3. 20   3. 21  1) W the number of words in the SRAM PUF. 2) B the number of bits in each word. 3) Golden value v(w, b) associated with each bit in the SRAM PUF based on criteria in equation  3. 18. The user now has the ability to choose the challenge response pairs to use. 3. 6. 4. Bit error rate (BER) The bit error rate of an SRAM cell is due to two mutually exclusive events: the bit is measured as  0  when it should be  1  or it is measured as  1  when it should be  0. We can write the BER as where A is the probability that the SRAM bit is measured  0  when it should be  1  because ap   ai and B is the probability that the SRAM bit is measured  1  when it should be  0  because ap   ai. The two probabilities are for the case when ap   ai, and for the case when ap   ai. 3. 6. 5.",

We can now define the system-level signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a tagged SRAM cell as the ratio of the energy due random process variations relative to dynamic noise energy: where the contribution of the random process variations (through ap and σp) and dynamic noise (through σn) are beyond the control of the device manufacturer. Bits in an SRAM word, and for that matter, all bits in the SRAM, do not have the same SNR. The mininum SNR is when μp   ai: On the other hand, maximum SNR occurs when either ap   0 or when ap   1. Since ai   0. 5, we can write: When SNR   SNRmin, the response to the challenge is noisy. Similarly when SNR   SNRmax, the response to the challenge is more stable and less dependent on noise. 3. 7.

Algorithm  2: repeated challenge The basic idea behind Algorithm  2 is to eliminate dynamic noise by repeating the steps used by the manufacturer to obtain the golden reference SRAM as discussed in section 3. 6. 2. Algorithm  2 performs N initializations of the SRAM PUF and prepares an N   B response matrix R' whose rows are the individual responses r' n  for the same challenge c. A row vector x is obtained as the sum of columns of R'. where SumColumns(R') sums the individual B columns of matrix R' to produce a row B-vector x. The sum operation effectively cancels out the random dynamic noise which effectively performs repetition coding or majority voting. The response of the device being authenticated is estimated in bitwise fashion. The bit at location b of w'2 is obtained as: 3. 26  Using the helper data w, the error-corrected response r2 is obtained. The steps used by Algorithm  2 are shown in Figure 3. 14.

    "content": "8. Security of PUF-based IoT devices The smart home is the target of several attacks such as (Fakroon et al. 2020): 1) replay; 2) eavesdropping; 3) device loss; 4) impersonation; 5) man-in-the-middle; 6) forward-backward secrecy; 7) user credentials; 8) session key guessing; 9) user identification and tracking; 10) side-channel; 11) over-production and counterfeiting; 12) deep learning and machine learning; 13) reverse engineering; 14) nonvolatile memory attacks. We should note several general principles to ensure the security of the telehealth system, which includes smart home and IoT devices. The attacks mentioned above depend on getting the secret key associated with each IoT device through targeting the NVRAM content. Here this is prevented through storing the secret keys within the circuit structure of the PUF. Studying the CRP responses is thwarted by hiding the IoT device response r and never sending it between the communicating entities. This provides a level of protection against using deep learning to mimic the PUF function. Secret session keys K and hash values h are based on chaining and context such that a previous hash value or current device environment are used to generate a session K and h in addition to the response r (Fakroon et al. 2021). The use of PUFs in IoT devices constitutes an inexpensive means of providing tamper-proofing to a certain degree. It is not expected that each IoT device would be a root of trust (RoT) but at least it provides immunity to reverse engineering and tampering. Security measures must be layered starting from the physical layer (PUFs), then the communication layer and ending with the application layer. Multifactor authentication is also feasible here since each PUF can provide some of these factors. 3. 9.",

    "content": "3. 9. Conclusions This chapter developed novel statistical models for SRAM PUF performance. The main parameters affecting the SRAM PUF performance were identified and techniques to measure them were proposed. These parameters can be estimated by the manufacturer at the pre-deployment phase and can also be measured in the field. This chapter also proposed three algorithms for generating CRP and establishing device authentication and secure key exchange. Algorithm  1 is based on a single challenge. Algorithm  2 is based on repeated challenge. Algorithm  3 is based on repeated challenge with bit selection. We noted that Algorithm  1 can be used when the SRAM word size is B   256 bits. Further, Algorithm  1 introduces a rather large number of bits in error in the response. Two new algorithms are proposed in this chapter: Algorithm  2 and Algorithm  3. These two algorithms solved the two main problems associated with noisy PUF responses: the need to use a large number of bits B and the large number of errors in the response. 3. 10.

However, these applications generate numerous concerns and challenges. Data is used to observe, manage and transmit information to other devices through the Internet. This enables certain actions to be performed remotely in order to acheive certain conditions. The majority of IoT smart home automation devices use applications (apps) or voice-based instructions. There are therefore a number of management and technical concerns that need to be mapped properly in order to use these applications effectively. Monitoring, energy management and transformation processes require a prominent and well-built control and management strategy. In addition, the data controls and management come from a wide range of resources, which further complicate the procedure for data protection, in order to create secure real time networks. As we move towards significant deployment of smart home IoT infrastructure and applications, smart home IoT network security systems have been recognized as a major concern. Therefore, the implications of network interconnection and security need to be a top priority. This chapter discusses the most significant IoT network challenges and their implications for smart home security.",

The challenges for the networks are presented, with reference to existing practices and available standards and initiatives, along with the relevant global standards. 4. 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is now a buzzword that is spreading amongst the general public. It is a rapidly developing area that is constantly evolving, and many applications are expected to appear in the near future (Yousuf et al. 2019). The most commonly-used description of the IoT is  a cluster of things that are well-established or embedded through electric energy, actuators, sensors, software, and connected devices, using the Internet to bring together and replace data throughout the home and all other devices  (Yang et al. 2017). The relationships between a large number of things and the Internet makes it possible to steer the world away from detachment (Broll et al. 2009). The most valuable aspect of IoT processes is their ability to connect people with other people, objects with other objects, things with other things, and people with things. IoT devices are created using processing power and sensors that make it possible for them to be controlled in a number of surroundings (Li et al. 2017). IoT devices develop a network of smart things that allow the general public to connect and communicate with objects within the infrastructure of the Internet (Padyab and Stahlbrost 2018).",

    "content": "2017). IoT devices develop a network of smart things that allow the general public to connect and communicate with objects within the infrastructure of the Internet (Padyab and Stahlbrost 2018). The increasing accessibility and variety of IoT devices provide opportunities for people to use Internet services that are self-designed, self-configured, self-controlled and self-managed through smart tools and techniques, anytime or anywhere (Atzori et al. 2010). The IoT can be viewed as a collection of unified objects and devices that enable the community and things to connect to anyone and anything, anywhere and at any time, with any service or network (Balte et al. 2015). According to Statista, in 2017 the number of devices connected to the Internet reached over 20 billion units (Gyarmathy 2020). Within a short period of time, the IoT has become more intelligent and has therefore been proven as a promising area for new cutting-edge technology and applications. The world is turning into an IoT universe, where several technologies work together with the IoT to connect things or devices. This is having a transformative effect on the way the world currently operates across several areas, including connected smart homes with energy management and home automation, smart health, industrial process management and public protection (Yousuf et al. 2019). However, with the growing number of IoT devices, interoperability between IoT systems is now crucial. In 2023, up to  1. 1 trillion is expected to be spent on the IoT worldwide (Gyarmathy 2020). Several industries have formerly recognized IoT devices as an obvious valuable asset for the business. This not only drives innovation, but also supports enhanced security and privacy (James et al. 2015).",

Models or standards are essential for existing businesses, protecting customers against the threats of proprietary resolutions. Standards reduce the level of threat for stockholders and help in the wide-spread application and sustainable development of IoT systems (Guillemin et al. 2013; Brass 2018). According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the overall global cost of IoT deployment reached  745 billion in 2019, with an increase of 15. 4  from the previous year. Smart home IoT devices are being used to automate climate control, lighting, electrical devices, entertainment and home security systems. The IoT market is steadily growing, as IoT is now known as an enabler in terms of enhancing efficiency in different fields through logistics and transformation, automation, transportation, and so on (Miorandi et al. 2012). IoT is enabling the smart home to support the automation in a number of ways. IoT devices connect things and objects from different surroundings to a particularly large network using an Internet Protocol (IP); this then becomes the basis for the development of smart homes, smart environments, smart industrial units, and so on. IoT enables home devices to be extra smart, remote, convenient and integrated (Alaa et al. 2017).",

Smart home IoT devices allow data to be collected in real time, offering valuable services to the people using them; for instance, reduced energy consumption and therefore energy savings, protection, communication, transportation, home automation and numerous innovations within the forthcoming environment (Padyab and Stahlbrost 2018). IoT-based smart home environments with key components and interrelated connectivity are presented in Figure 4. 1 (Vinodhan et al. 2016; Jian et al. 2017). In IoT and smart home automation, the devices are connected through a local area network (LAN) and the Internet. The LAN allows communication between the devices and outer surface of the applications. A server and its database is also connected through the LAN, with the server controlling and managing the devices and activity logs, generating reports, replying to queries and performing the relevant command lines. For comprehensive or common tasks, the smart home server transfers the data to the cloud and remotely activates tasks with the use of APIs. Additionally, the database stores and processes data collected from cloud services and sensors. The Internet connection enables the end user to communicate with the smart home to obtain existing information and execute tasks remotely. The Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) cryptography algorithm is commonly used in the communication, encrypting or decrypting messages using a public or private key (Mao et al. 2018; Domb 2019). To deal with this, power from the local smart home processors is used for the RSA calculation and more complex computing tasks are processed through the cloud. The results will subsequently be transferred to the IoT sensor to be assembled and compiled, in order to produce the RSA encryption or decryption code, hence supporting the IoT security (Li et al. 2011; Jian et al.",

Figure 4. 1. Smart home system using IoT Devices such as thermostats, lights, windows or doors, along with numerous others are the typical components of smart homes (see: https: iot5. net iot-applications smart-home-iot-applications ) (Alaa et al. 2017). Smart home automation through IoT devices enables people to manage their lives; the main objective of IoT designers and producers is to revolutionize controlling and monitoring systems to support smart home applications. These include devices such as power plugs, weather sensors, smart lights, door sensors, vibration sensors, motion sensors, smart gateways, smoke detectors and inlet switches (Yang et al. 2018). However, as this is a relatively new objective, and associated technologies are still under development, substantial challenges need to be overcome (Joo and Choi 2017). The general idea behind smart homes centers around the electronic networking technology used to integrate appliances, devices and protection to create a fully integrated home, controlled and monitored centrally through a particular mechanism (Froiz-Míguez et al. 2018). IoT based home automation also highlights the challenges associated with the varied access, sensing, processing of data and information, services, applications and other sections related to network security (Yousuf et al. 2019).",

The data or information collected with reference to persons and devices represent the probable security breaches. This makes it a complex task to encourage the adoption of IoT enabling home devices (Gubbi et al. 2013; Dutton 2014). IoT enabled home devices can make life more straightforward, however these devices have become vulnerable to a number of security threats. Consequently, it is particularly important to offer better security and access control, and include a high level of data integrity to secure the devices of a smart home (Li et al. 2017; Yousuf et al. 2019). Currently, a vast amount of secure, sensitive or confidential data is susceptible to leakage through the convenient IoT techniques. 4. 2. IoT and smart home security Using IoT-based devices and sensors, a smart home is able to remotely control, monitor and make services available, as requested by customers (Perrig et al. 2002; Yim and Choi 2012). The initial smart home tools and technology became accessible to customers at the beginning of the 21st century (Morris et al. 2013). Each type of tool and technology related to smart homes enables customers to monitor and control the associated home devices via smart home apps or other networked devices (D Ulizia et al. 2010). The IoT provides devices with plans and procedures to increase their security potential. All appliances or devices that have varying functions (smart sensors, smart cars and smart appliances) become fairly susceptible to attacks by hackers, while the existing procedures fail to offer complete control of security.",

All appliances or devices that have varying functions (smart sensors, smart cars and smart appliances) become fairly susceptible to attacks by hackers, while the existing procedures fail to offer complete control of security. Thus the growth of secure IoT systems with lightweight security apps will resolve the most important requirements in the future. Technology has changed the community conversation on buying and selling products, education, medication, farming, as well as the security. Consequently, IoT based smart home systems contain inbuilt security to combat the threats. Hence the numerous wireless network solutions, such as wireless Ethernet, ultra wide band (UWB), Bluetooth and others related to the field of home networking come into play (Yashwant et al. 2020). In view of the fact that Bluetooth is now widespread in mobile devices, it provides a cost-effective and secure solution to support the wireless network for IoT-based home systems. With increased growth in smart homes and improvements to a considerable number of manufactured smart home goods on the market, home security has become extremely fashionable (Manyika et al. 2013). Additionally, the prototype implementation system would be an excellent solution to support access monitoring and the control system for smart home security in IoT.",

A number of scenarios are involved in the development of communications procedures for the purpose of smart home security, leveraging standard procedures and encoding the interfaces, along with providing automation platforms that reduce the number of threats within dissimilar computing platforms and appliances (Drahansky et al. 2016). Consequently, smart homes contain appliances such as refrigerators, thermostats, home security, self-operating vacuum cleaners, clean-up and safeguarding devices, as well cameras, light sensors and motion sensors, which also collect data and information (Drahansky et al. 2016). A large amount of confidential information and susceptible data exists, such as: addresses, locations, representations and network related information. The information can be available to the device manufacturer, mobile application holder, and intermediary dealers or the community, depending on their rights. There are small numbers of offerings that deal with confidentiality in the environment of smart home security (Kraemer et al. 2018). However, numerous modification techniques are in place to analyze the confidentiality and security associated with IoT-related information processing and threats (Almusaylim and Zaman 2019). Considering the publicly authorized aspects of security in IoT related areas, government associations are becoming heavily involved in IoT based security and interoperability from a standards perspective. When customers obtain IoT-based smart home devices openly from service providers, they may possibly work with the extremely insignificant knowledge while approving the terms and conditions (Ts and Cs), and privacy policy (PP). A significant number of standards have been specified by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). For most of the standards, interoperability is key to increasing security in smart homes and allowing customers and commercial organizations to communicate (Philippe et al. 2011).",

The most important technological concerns include: Regulations: Government directives protect the computer systems, as well as other information technology components, with the intention of improving security. A lot of associations and companies pitch for regulations to secure the information systems from cyber-attacks and governments issue regulations. For example, NERC-CIP for power efficiency in North America, and also instruction on security of Network Information Systems (NIS Directive) in Europe. Associations need to follow the regulations to plan the new devices and processes. Standards: Facts and reports on how certain approaches should be relayed in a reliable way are very important. Methods are usually standardized in a published resource, in an attempt to improve the cyber security and cyber surroundings of a consumer or association. The main concern is reducing the risk, together with preventing and mitigating the attacks.

Guidelines: Detailed instructions on the usage and implementation of techniques are required to protect smart home systems and their surroundings. Guidelines are related to standards and need measured references and approval from the stakeholders. For instance, the NISTIR 7628 guidelines are in place to support smart grid-based home security (Pillitteri 2014). Policies: Guiding principles and procedures meet the security requirements of smart homes, organizations, as well as the society at large. Compliance with the policies has become compulsory. Policies offer top-down requests in support of smart home, business and commerce, in order to secure the information and assets. They work with the set of laws, regulation and authorized requests. Procedures: In order to apply standards and policies, detailed procedures need to be defined. Procedures contain sequences of detailed steps and instructions that should be followed in order to achieve a target. These become mandatory to illustrate and guide the end users. For instance, the maximum amount of time for a user account password to become obsolete and indicating the new requests to be produced. It is important to note that standards are not yet mandatory at the time of implementing and designing the systems and platforms of IoT based smart home security.

Similar application-related techniques on security may include facial recognition, fingerprint scanning and password protection. These applications observe the behavior of customers and consequently improve security. The amalgamation of technologies such as machine learning, omnipresent wireless communications, embedded systems, and real-time analytics has led to the development of new applications with IoT potential to support a large number of domains (Hoque et al. 2019). Latent IoT applications include the remote based monitoring and control of smart home devices, energy consumption and managing smart light and smart lock type devices (Ahmed et al. 2016; Davidson et al. 2018; Hoque et al. 2019). For example, the customer details needed to access the smart lock must be mentioned and stored within the server, together with a time and date schedule. This schedule is able to further utilize to foresee the date and time when the customer will come into the house and handle the security. When the door is locked, the lights should turn off automatically, and when the door is unlocked, the lights should turn on automatically. Anyone can set holidays or vacations on the devices and the system will be on the highest security until the customer returns. Users are also able to set provisional keys in support of the household or in favor of visitors (Davidson et al. 2018). A smart home security system design has been presented in Figure 4. 2. This kind of smart home security system can be very cost effective (Hoque et al. 2019).

An Android operating system also becomes essential for the development of applications involving XML, Python, JAVA, etc. Figure 4. 2. Smart home security system 4. 3. IoT network security Network security continues to be a substantial concern within the smart home community. In order to combat the network attacks, a number of security improvement strategies have been created and distributed within the Internet community. Surprisingly, these attacks are frequently either customized to run off detection or completely new ones to forfeit the plans. Although it may not be possible for the average user to understand, the attacker s attempt to infiltrate Internet related systems presents the most common and recurrent problem. For this reason, different levels of network security have been established in IoT on the basis of network levels. Customers are obtaining IoT devices for smart homes on the assumption that the producer has embedded suitable security in the devices. Therefore, in a fundamental approach, the common security threats are identified and resolved at the network level (Sivaraman et al. 2015; Ray et al. 2020). The concerns over network security have become more complicated as the range of devices has increased past computers such as desktops or laptops. These systems use operating systems (MacOS, Linux, and Windows) with small memories and protection mechanisms. Commonly, these devices are able to connect via peer devices or networks, using similar protocols to that of wireless networks, such as BLE, Bluetooth, NFC, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, LoRaWan, Thread etc. (Gomez and Paradells 2010).",

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has put in a strong effort during the establishment of required light weight communication protocols in support of controlled environments, in addition to the existing IP network (Lin and Bergmann, 2016). This contains the IPv6 in excess of Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN: RFC 6282) (Hui and Thubert 2011), the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL: RFC 6550) (Winter et al. 2012), along with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP: RFC 7252) (Castellani et al. 2017). The modest instance contains the suitable access control procedures that safeguard the particular IoT device. Whereas a typical instance may engage energetic procedures that modify the access control derived from the situation (for example, the members of family that are present or absent from home). Complicated security similar to those that need a mixture of network management and data analytics becomes absent right now, and is able to satisfy network level security. The network level security has been described in Figure 4. 3, where the security management provider interconnects with the Internet service provider or the tools of home router from one side, using dynamic application programming interfaces (APIs), and with home customers using a user-friendly graphical interface from the other side. The purpose of the SMP is to implement the control of configuration in excess of the Internet service provider (ISP) network, as well as the home router for the customer (Dahiya 2017; Lin and Bergmann 2016).",

SMP procedures and benefits: The security management provider offers apps or portals of customization interfaces to customers, translating these into network level functions summoned by application programming interfaces (APIs). This purposely decouples the security management provider from the infrastructure based dealer or operator, so that multiple objectives are able to compete on behalf of the procedure. The vendor of a home router or ISP could potentially develop SMP abilities in the home, increasing maintenance costs and thus income. A content provider (for example, Netflix or Google) or cloud service provider (for example, Apple or Amazon) may also have an interest in the procedure, in order to develop its individual services. Otherwise, an innovative competitor could adopt a similar procedure with better analytics and visibility of home network systems. The ease with which SMP procedures can be implemented is a potential asset to business organizations that can help to overcome the existing stagnation in home Internet contributions (Lin and Bergmann 2016). Figure 4. 3. Network level security Internet service provider and home router vendor procedures and benefits: Nowadays, home routers (like commercial routers) are included in the network and may have various management interfaces; they may have come from different vendors.

This decreases the growth related problem for vendors, permitting them to concentrate on viable improvement, whereas the model of cloud based control is able to provide the best response to the aspect of device usage. A corresponding argument affects the ISP, which offers Internet connectivity at low-margins. ISPs may monetize the large level of marketplace service customization, and they can also decrease the load of consumer management. The configuration of network APIs can be computerized using software defined network (SDN) technology and consequently, the ISP is able to sustain them at a small price (Lin and Bergmann 2016).

Embedded systems and devices include a wide range of appliances contained by the inhabitant, business, healthcare, automotive, and other types of users. Usually, embedded systems include firmware or operating systems in support of designed, managed and controlled security related issues in IoT related smart home applications. These devices become smaller in size due to low power consumption, as well as low computing power, such as when monitoring the sensitivity rate.

Virtual or cyber security procedures and benefits: security is the major concern in positioning IoT-based smart homes. IoT systems make use of wireless communication protocols to provide customers and devices with the ability to drive and take delivery of information involving each other with control and secure IoT-based home appliances. This can build up a complete system that is extremely susceptible toward the attacks of hackers. Consequently, the systems and devices must be installed into the smart home within the security mode, ensuring that these are not observable toward any intruder. A protocol of Near Field Communication (NFC) can also be applied, and this enables the related devices to use peer-to-peer to set-up the communication (Song et al. 2008). Accordingly, they are allowed to transmit data with everyone within extremely close proximity.

This complexity deals with encrypted data on the dispatcher device after decrypting it on the target device and vice versa. The procedure of encryption is utilized based on the communication protocol of machine-to-machine (M2M). Customer procedure and benefits: Customers require the security in support for smart homes to be enhanced further than through the ISP or router vendor only. The main concern of the customer is learned and stored within the cloud, and re-established though the subscriber, which modifies the home router or ISP. The customer should be able to adapt security from the cloud, with the opportunity to modernize the configuration as a tool. ISPs offer management and control of the home gateway, also providing the physical home gateway subscriber or a virtual instance through the cloud (for example, vCPE). This theory becomes important and the resolution is given towards tasks pessimistic of inheritance through the network address translator (NAT), allowing smart home gateways (Lin and Bergmann 2016; Dahiya 2017).

The innovative modules connected to FloodLight execute the API to support access control, so that access control procedures (derived from a remote IP) can be pushed via the outdoor SMP unit to support a particular home device. SMP Security composer: A security composer or Ruby-on-Rails is executed, and seizes the position and logic required by the SMP to deal with security in support of the subscriber. The ISP using the aforesaid APIs interrelates with the front-end gateway, as well as customer apps, using RESTful APIs. This is performed on the REST rules or commands from the customer apps or portal. This can recover the suitable state information subsequent toward the command of the subscriber, with the proper series of ISP and APIs toward the attainment of the functionality (Lin and Bergmann 2016). Web-based app: Front-end support is made available to the customers to modify services, as well as execute them in HTML or JavaScript. The customer is able to see and manage it through a web-based app. Customers can see the smart home devices scheduled to work and they can access any support of security locations. The SMP seizes the information depending on the suitable techniques toward securing that exact device, and is able to insert correct access control procedures using the API network, possibly with the perspective of information from the home. Therefore, the service of enclosing the SMP on condition of the IoT security becomes an added value service with the help of other supporting devices and mechanisms.

The smart light bulb connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, and iOS or Android apps propel the most wanted commands to regulate the settings of smart bulb. Nowadays, customers would nearly all be aware of this attack, and would know how to block it. The SMP appeals to the API network in the direction of insert suitable access control procedures that enable only identified users to access the smart bulb (Lin et al. 2016; Dahiya 2017). In terms of roaming, there may be a mobile app, installed on the customer s phone, that propels heartbeat messages toward the SMP through the communal IP address. This is then actively programmed into the access control list of the home router or the edge router. This technique may offer protected access to the smart bulb at the network level, along with a variety of IoT devices. A technique to improve the security of the Nest smoke alarm installed in smart homes and organizations can also be applied. This device is connected via a Wi-Fi network to cloud-based servers offering real time emergency alerts to the customer app. As the device holds the light and motion sensors, this becomes a valid anxiety that the device is able to track customers within the smart home and provide these details to Nest. There has been enhanced functionality that obstructs the Dropcam from uploading or recording video to the cloud when the customer is at home. It is amazing that this can be done automatically each time via the security alert.",

Therefore, certain suppliers provide IoT security as a service and energetically control the firewall procedures in support of the customer (with access switch of ISP or at the home gateway) that observes and controls the network level functions in support of every IoT device. Usually, by assessing IoT devices several at a time, allpurpose procedures can be implemented for all IoT devices, so that the improved security assertions can then be made available to the device manufacturer. 4. 4. Prevailing standards and initiatives With the increase in Internet access, the adoption of IoT in smart homes is also increasing. Correspondingly, IoT security concerns are also increasing. The market size of European smart home security is estimated to reach 7. 95 billion USD by 2024 (Sovacool et al. 2020). The smart home security marketplace can also be attributed to the growing crime rate around the world. Due to the growing crime rate, customers are gradually paying more attention to security and safety systems, particularly in the housing sector. In order to combat the challenges, a number of home security standards have been developed to offer interoperability among the large range of associated products and services (Khoa et al. 2020; Sovacool et al. 2020; Sowah et al. 2020).",

The most important organizations involved in the development of the significant standards include: Open Connecivity Foundation (OCF): In the smart home space, OCF became the biggest traverse business association in 2016, and its contribution in the amalgamation of the two most important proposals in support of interoperability is really remarkable. AllJoyn and IoTivity are the open source frameworks, which have been sponsored by OCF. Both of these standards work towards communication and encourage interoperability in technologies within the IoT. The recent creature is also functioning on an integrated IoT standard sustaining OCF stipulation. Zigbee Alliance: Fundamentally amalgamated in smart home systems, Zigbee technology is implemented through the leading global service installers, suppliers and dealers. Supported by more than 400 associates, the ZigBee home automation standard is devoted to interoperability between an array of products irrespective of the producer. In 2017, the CES alliance completed a considerable move to advance interoperability with the creation of Dotdot, which is predicted to be a worldwide language in support of IoT. Dotdot is derived from the improvement of the widespread applicative upper level, which allows interconnection between Zigbee products and other products using Bluetooth and WiFi protocols. The ZigBee Alliance is approaching the standard in support of home devices, from lighting systems and temperature control to smoke detectors and security monitors. The ZigBee requirement is well-matched to smart home systems due to its consistency, low power consumption, and interoperability. Bluetooth Low Energy: Marketed as Bluetooth Smart, Bluetooth Low Energy has been promoted by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) as a smart, power friendly adaptation of wireless technology, in support of dot to dot contacts. Bluetooth provides the framework for direct connection from a tablet or smartphone, enabling customers to manage their smart home devices from a portable device.",

Bluetooth provides the framework for direct connection from a tablet or smartphone, enabling customers to manage their smart home devices from a portable device. The Bluetooth SIG suggests that the Bluetooth mesh protocol should be favored. A mesh protocol would enhance the physical variety of devices via the Bluetooth network and it may possibly drop the power utilization. IFTTT ( If This Then That ): This is a web tool that enables numerous applications and services to be linked using commands that trigger and automate actions. Within the smart home region (Sovacool et al. 2020), IFTTT enables devices to communicate with each other openly, without performing as a hub to exclude a channel. For example, if thermostat X s temperature reaches 90, the system Y must activate an alarm. IFTTT is implemented and utilized through several considerable performers within the smart home. IFTTT perform operations through Samsung s SmartThings, LIFXlight bulbs, Nest thermostats or within Google Home. Open APIs: Several industries have improved platforms to create devices that work together using Samsung s SmartThings or Apple s HomeKit. Accordingly, developers of related inventions are able to execute SmartThings as well as Homekit using similar software, or in a few cases, with hardware growth. The most recent competitor is Amazon with its smart voice sponsor Alexa within the Echo device, which provides an innovative and easy method to interrelate products. Amazon has unconfined the smart home skill API with the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), which allows innovators to provide Alexa with skills or abilities, allowing Alexa to communicate with the related inventions.",

Amazon has unconfined the smart home skill API with the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), which allows innovators to provide Alexa with skills or abilities, allowing Alexa to communicate with the related inventions. Eventually, these platforms could possibly be converted into de facto standards, the same as the system device. The creator would profit from the improved visibility while customers would be able to attach and utilize them without difficulty (see: https: ec. europa. eu growth tools-databases dem ). Thread: Thread is an innovative low power wireless network standard for smart home security. The standard protocol sustains IPv6 by 6LoWPAN (Sovacool et al. 2020). The proposal behind Thread is the resolution of consistency, safety, power, and similarity concerns that regularly occur within smart home products. Thread is put on the physical layer that becomes the source of ZigBee devices, where an OEM is able to simply renew its ZigBee devices to sustain Thread through the development of software. Thread is very useful and provides an extra inclusive solution than earlier low-power wireless standards. Constrained Application Protocol (COAP): This is a standard communication protocol for resource restrained devices in IoT. Several IoT deployments need proxies for asynchronous communication involving edge devices. This actually enables the proxies to access the vulnerable parts of CoAP messages (Gunnarsson et al. 2021).",

    "content": "This actually enables the proxies to access the vulnerable parts of CoAP messages (Gunnarsson et al. 2021). The latest standard protocol Object Security for Constrained Restful Environments (OSCORE) offers back-to-back security in support of CoAP messages by third party proxies. It executes the predictable services, through the improvements of significant security and privacy. OSCORE resourcefully offers sensitive trustworthy security and encryption on the dissimilar parts of CoAP messages (Gunnarsson et al. 2021). To evaluate whether the related security aspects consume a large amount of the limited resources that exist on a restricted device, OSCORE is implemented as an open-source protocol and its effectiveness is evaluated. OSCORE has been standardized to a large extent under the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (Selander et al. 2019). Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS): This is an Internet standard based security channel providing the transport layer that secures communications in excess of untrustworthy datagram protocols (e. g. UDP). Security is ensured by using two nodes that become the adjoining transport layer hops. DTLS is a secure reproduction of the TLS protocol (Dierks et al. 2008) with corresponding security assurances. For example, it prevents eavesdropping, interfering, tampering and message imitation. DTLS, in particular, is modified to support the use of UDP rather than the transmission control protocol (TCP). The innovative CoAP requirement (Shelby 2014) specified DTLS as a single security method to secure the CoAP exchange messages.",

    "content": "DTLS, in particular, is modified to support the use of UDP rather than the transmission control protocol (TCP). The innovative CoAP requirement (Shelby 2014) specified DTLS as a single security method to secure the CoAP exchange messages. There are two communicating devices, which primarily use the DTLS handshake protocol to swap cryptographic key material and network information to support message security. Specifically, one device performs like a client, while another performs like a server. The defaulting handshake relies on documentation, excluding annexes derived from symmetric pre-shared keys (Eronen 2005), or on raw public keys (Wouters et al. 2014). A comprehensive handshake determines a protected session, wherein the client and server are able to start swapping data secured by considered key material. Secure communication is subsequently accomplished through the use of the DTLS record protocol, which ensures the consistency and security of message transfers. 4. 5. Conclusion The IoT is not a perfect application in a smart home as the security is always very critical. Even though the overall nature of security threats is also related to other domains such as confidentiality, authentication, and access threats, the vulnerability is still high considering the sensitivity of home-based applications. In addition, because the networked system is user-friendly, the physical accessibility of the systems leads to another big threat. The heterogeneity of the different devices and the fixed firmware further contributes to the system complexity. A number of solutions have been proposed that recognize and block the related threats at the network level and can contribute to the security of IoT-based smart homes. However, there is still a big gap to be bridged to offer seamless network security across all usable devices in IoT-based smart homes. 4. 6. References Ahmed, M. S. , Hoque, M. A. , Khattak, A. J.",

IoT security is based on the zero-trust philosophy   all communications are encrypted, no unidentifiable device is accepted on the network, each device has to provide its passport with a description of its network behavior and better encryption key generation. This IoT solution also addresses potential configuration problems by allowing trusted third-party providers to remotely access and correctly configure home small medium office hubs as well as informing users about any potentially harmful behavior or external access to their equipment. 5. 1. Introduction With the advancement of new technologies and the rapid proliferation of devices at home and in cities, users are now faced with a myriad of possible security vulnerabilities. The risk is particularly large, especially with IoT environments that increasingly integrate the devices of our daily lives at home and in the city, including electrical and gas appliances. In this context, any stolen private data can be used to manipulate sensitive information that endangers the personal, social and financial lives of citizens. Privacy and data protection are fundamental human rights that are strictly established within the United Nations (UN). A prerequisite for this is building strong rules and technology frameworks to empower citizens and protect personal data and privacy. However, some members of the digital society are more vulnerable as they are less prepared to confront cyber-attacks and personal data breaches, such as biometric data breaches, resulting from a lost or stolen fingerprint and facial recognition data or through malicious mobile apps; or data breaches in the gaming industry, compromising million of accounts containing usernames, email addresses, IP addresses and hashed passwords.",

    "content": "However, some members of the digital society are more vulnerable as they are less prepared to confront cyber-attacks and personal data breaches, such as biometric data breaches, resulting from a lost or stolen fingerprint and facial recognition data or through malicious mobile apps; or data breaches in the gaming industry, compromising million of accounts containing usernames, email addresses, IP addresses and hashed passwords. The scale, value and sensitivity of personal data in the cyberspace domain, in particular, the IoT domain, are significantly on the rise and citizens are typically uncertain about who monitors, accesses and modifies their personal data. Personal data breaches may facilitate abuse by third parties, including cyber-threats such as coercion, extortion and corruption. One of the fundamental privacy challenges is the possibility that, in systems that depend on user settings, a large number of options may not be adopted by the general public due to the difficulty in their use. In addition to this, for the most part, service providers still rely on the traditional limited consent-based model, fostering binary ( allow deny ) systems that do not easily allow the management of large quantities of data. On the other hand, full granularity of choice for each data set, authorised party and purpose may engender  consent fatigue  and alienate users. This reflects a tension between granularity and usability, both of which need to be taken into account during the design of the cloud and mobile services (Hansen and Limniotis 2018). From the point of view of security, the main challenges are related to the lack of adoption of client side encryption or layered encryption.",

On related security challenges, stronger authentication measures are needed, as well as more transparent procedures for dealing with data breaches and other incidents. In addition to this, due to the diversity of the IoT domain, it seems necessary to have different levels of security and privacy protection. The history of the IoT also reflects its weaknesses, in relation to data privacy protection in particular. Increased data flow through all local networks on a daily basis renders every attempt by individuals, companies and institutions to follow and control it impossible, except for those who are highly specialized. Network traffic also usually contains a certain amount of sensitive data, often digitally manipulated in some way (e. g. a variety of formats and data structures required by different applications). Such a situation makes a network breach or misuse of information even simpler during the course of an ordinary IoT operation. There still a need for novel solutions to better protect users' personal data, to ensure that data usage remains consistent with laws and legality and to help citizens to better monitor and audit their security, privacy and personal data protection, enabling them to become more engaged and active in the fight against cyber-risks.",

These innovative solutions can benefit from a self-sovereign identity, distributed ledger technologies and federated data processing to accomplish these needs. This chapter outlines a first attempt to provide a solution to security and privacy challenges of the Internet of Things. The main contributions are as follows: To introduce the zero-trust philosophy and architecture for improved overall network security and better encryption. To define the use of Unified Secure Communications, Services and Web-Applications as a foundation for home small medium network hubs based on existing, tested and verified solutions (e. g. Pi Platform). To discuss methods and effective tools that could assist in creating networks that are both easy to use and secure not only for network members, but for trusted third-party providers and other remote users. The next section presents a brief overview of the IoT with particular attention paid to security and data privacy. Section 5. 3 highlights security and privacy challenges in order to clarify this issue and lay the foundation for the solution that will be proposed later in this chapter. In section 5. 4 the authors have tried, within the chapter s limits, to draw the outline of the current state of the art in the field of IoT security.",

Its purpose is twofold, to assist the reader in understanding the relation the proposed solution has with the current competitive solutions and to underline the main streams of the current work on the global level in order to emphasize differences with the new solution. Section 5. 5 presents a zero-trust approach for security and privacy protection. This section provides all answers to problems listed previously, defines capabilities for applications, including compatibility and interoperability, and sets grounds for a practical example. In combination with the specific use case, section 5. 6 demonstrates the applicability of this zero-trust approach in the form of a secure and private interactive intelligent conversational system and paves the way to the final sections on discussion and conclusions. 5. 2. Internet of Things The term Internet of Things (IoT for short) is neither precisely defined nor is its history exactly known. It is likely that it was first used in a presentation by Kevin Ashton in 1999 who, at the time, worked for Procter and Gamble (Ashton 2009). In that presentation he presented his reflections on using new technologies such as RFID to track a large number of physical objects and collect information from them without human involvement.",

Today, the IoT has become an umbrella term for technologies enabling the communication, acquisition and processing of information from various kinds of networked devices. There is however no strong agreement on what types of devices and communication exactly belong to the IoT. Some authors, especially those in the tradition of Wireless Sensor Networks, consider only small resource-constrained devices that use low-power and or long-range communication to send sensor data to central data collection and processing points to be IoT devices. Others extend the definition to all sorts of devices with specific purposes that are deployed on a large scale, such as home routers, smart home equipment and mobile phones. The development of the concept of the IoT has been enabled by progress in several fields in recent decades. The field of Wireless Sensor Networks has driven the mass production of low-power embedded systems with radio interfaces. The work on Wireless Adhoc Networks has contributed new network protocols that allow an efficient and robust exchange of information in unreliable networks. Thanks to Cloud computing, the large amount of data produced by an Internet of Things deployment can be processed in an adaptive and flexible way without requiring its users to acquire and manage their own server infrastructure.",

Finally, Machine-to-Machine application protocols, such as CoAP (Shelby et al. 2014) or MQTT1, are used to exchange information between the various components without the need for human intervention. Zhao and Ge (2013) introduced a widely accepted general model of the IoT with three layers which we present here in a slightly extended version that allows for IoT devices with actuator capabilities: The perception layer consists of the IoT devices, i. e. field devices with sensor or actuator functions. For cost reasons and convenience (changing batteries), these devices are often resource-constrained in terms of computation, memory and energy and are based on embedded hardware platforms, running small optimized operating systems such as RIOT2 or Contiki3. The network layer is responsible for the collection, aggregation and transmission of the data sent or received by the devices in the perception layer. In modern IoT deployments, this layer not only comprises the communication networks and their protocols, but also the necessary infrastructure (often in the cloud) for storing and processing the data. The application layer contains all the applications and solutions driven by the sensory data. Various free and commercial frameworks exist to support the design and implementation of IoT applications. The larger vendors, such as Amazon4 and Google5, also provide management, storage and data processing services located in the network layer. Some vendors offer solutions that target specific use cases, most notably the smart home market, for example Samsung s SmartThings platform6, and industrial applications7, the latter called the Industrial IoT.",

The fulfillment of this model required a small embedded operating system (OS) that would be capable of enabling data transfer from IoT devices to the Internet. Due to a variety of IoT applications with specific functions and inputs outputs, there are quite a few IoT operating systems in use to cover different requirements and demands. Almost every manufacturer and developer has their own preferences and ranking of IoT OSs. Therefore the list of IoT OSs in Table 5. 1 is just an indication with regard to variety. To the best of our knowledge not one of the listed IoT platforms provides complete transparency on what data can be collected or means for users to select and define which data can be processed. The documentation also does not specify ways to recover from a cyber attack nor tools to protect hidden data that could be exploited by third parties. It was felt that more responsibility is put on the developers who use these solutions. However, there is an increasing awareness among platform vendors of the necessity of providing online management services, performing regular OS patch updates and scrutinizing all incoming and outgoing network traffic. Furthermore, the significant growth in IoT deployment has led to the emergence of IoT platforms that provide users with the ability to quickly build, test, deploy and iterate on IoT-specific applications, supporting (Hammi 2018): 1) Easy integration of new devices and services.",

(2018) discussed the current state of security in IoT and its challenges and identified issues such as device identity, firmware updating and installation if new patches are available, implementation of security algorithms knowing that IoT devices are often resource-constrained, with limited power, and finally, trust between different components in the IoT paradigm. However, IoT security is not only limited to the IoT devices themselves. For binti Mohamad Noor and Hassan (2019), the objective of IoT security is privacy protection, confidentiality and the security of the users, infrastructures, data and devices, as well as the guarantee of the availability of services offered by an IoT ecosystem. In this context, Ogonji et al. (2020) propose a privacy and security taxonomy which highlights threats, attack surfaces, vulnerabilities and countermeasures. That the concerns of experts about the security of the IoT are not unfounded has been demonstrated in many recent incidents of security exploits and data breaches, such as the hacking of smart home devices (Marotti 2019) or home security cameras (Vigdor 2019). Systematic studies by researchers have revealed numerous vulnerabilities in products and services targeting the smart home market (Fernandes et al. 2016; Kafle et al. 2019). Even if an IoT device and its communication are secured, the complexity of the involved interactions among participating entities (devices, cloud services, mobile apps) results in security hazards that significantly increase the size of the attack surface (Zhou et al. 2019). Sometimes, the hazard is not accidental and or is exploited by the device manufacturer or the service provider themselves (McGregor 2019; Osborne 2019; Thapliyal 2019). To date, the issues identified are still topical, as no consensus has yet been reached to regulate this area. Attempts to arrive at standards are still ongoing.",

It should be noted that there are several links in the IoT chain, such as communication protocols, data formats, etc. , which require hard exchanges among many actors. While some authors (e. g. in Hassan et al. 2020) argue that new developments such as the Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT)12 improve privacy and reliability of transmission, it seems that existing standards for secure communication are not sufficient. When comparing security architectures, Ammar et al. (2018) show that different methodologies are followed by individual actors to provide other security properties in addition to the standards used for securing communications. The observations above are also valid for the so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). According to Liberg et al. (2020), the IIoT is part of critical system operation in many industrial use cases. Consequences of faulty operation can be disastrous. This is even truer when considering the pharma industry where IoT sensors and detectors can be used to supervise different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detect tool flaws, and can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities (Deepak et al. 2020). Munirathinam (Munirathinam 2020) considers security and privacy to be the number one challenge faced by the Industrial IoT. As we have said, due to the diversity of the IoT domain, it seems necessary to have different levels of security and privacy protection. The control of a street lamp does not have the same security and privacy requirements as a portable health gadget. Once identified, these levels can be used to automate and personalize security and privacy services.",

Once identified, these levels can be used to automate and personalize security and privacy services. The rapid evolution of the IoT domain and the emergence of new IoT products of all kinds lead the way towards reuse and adaptation strategies for security and privacy in order to avoid compromising platforms that are already operational. Before continuing, it is necessary to clarify some very important concepts used in the rest of this chapter. DEFINITION 5. 1. Cyber security risk is the possibility of losing data or to take control of your system, letting your private data be exposed or cyber-bulling, leading to financial or physical harm. DEFINITION 5. 2. Cyber-bullying13 is often based on altered information, helping to propagate false ideals and news. Cyber-bullying is defined as using electronic technologies in order to bully another person through the Internet. Unfortunately, cyber-bullying very often stays unreported. 5. 3. 2. Privacy challenges In the past, user data were limited to a few pieces of profile information, and the risk of exploiting this information was minimal. Today, the risk is great because more and more systems are tracking and storing even the smallest amount of user usage data, known as data analytics. Advances in artificial intelligence and communications networks such as 4G and 5G have also expanded the scope of data that can be exploited to include voice, video and image. As a result, the user has lost any possibility of preserving their privacy. With the increase in attacks against systems for data theft and malicious use, prices for security services will rise sharply.",

The result is that normal users and small businesses will be the most exposed and affected by the manipulation of their private data. Practical applications of solutions that handle privacy issues in the EU in general follow the guidance of corresponding institutions on the European level. The latest corresponding initiatives in the EU are related to the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), as part of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI). The EBSI is a joint initiative from the European Commission and the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP). EBSI provides a common, shared and open infrastructure based on blockchain technologies aimed at providing a secure and interoperable ecosystem that will enable the development of EU-wide cross-border digital services in the public sector. The driving concept of the EBSI, according to the EBP mission and vision, is to enhance efficiency, security, transparency and engagement, providing an interoperable framework for data and services that from one side enables the key EU visions (Once Only, Single Digital Gateway, . . . ) and at the same time allows each participating entity to run cross-border or internal services with secure access to needed information while maintaining autonomy running its own processes with its own technology stacks, regardless of the processes and technologies of any other entity14.",

In this sense, the implementation of decentralized biometric credential storage options in the EU is often proposed via blockchains using DIDs and DID documents within the IEEE 2410 2017 Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). Decentralized identifiers (DID) are a type of identifier that enables a verifiable, decentralized digital identity. They are an important component of decentralized web applications15. Also worth mentioning is eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services), EU regulation no. 910 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. Adopted on 23 July 2014, it provides a predictable regulatory environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities. From September 29, 201816, all organizations delivering public digital services in an EU member state must recognize electronic identification from all EU member states. When developing tools for IoT, data subjects may have or may not have particular rights depending on the legal basis that the data controller uses. Specifically, as you can see for the right to be forgotten (the right to deletion), the data subject may not have the right of erasure if the legal basis used by the data controller is a legal obligation (e. g. data relating to criminal proceedings) or public interest (e. g. information processed by a public authority in line with a public task).

The data controller may have other procedures in place for enabling a data subject to request the deletion of their data (e. g. by filling in an online form or sending an email to a particular email address) and might not wish to comply with the search and destroy program. In that case, there should be a way to indicate to the data subject the way to request the erasure, without necessarily having to notify the data protection authorities. Locating and erasing personal data is also processing, thus this will be processing personal data and will need a legal basis, which most likely will be consent or a contract. This will also need an additional legal basis for processing sensitive personal data (when applicable), which most likely would be explicit consent. When trawling publicly available registries and databases, some datasets may be protected under trade secrets and other confidentiality rules. However, inferred or derived data which occurred after processing the original data lose their protection because it will be easy to find subject s initially provided data, e. g. sexual orientation based on postal code. Notifying the data protection authority should occur only if the data subject has exhausted all other means of trying to exercise their right to deletion (right to be forgotten) for instance, by contacting the data controller and the relevant deadline for action has passed, otherwise the authorities may dismiss the claim as invalid.

    "content": "4. Literature review The aforementioned privacy and security challenges are typically addressed by technical mechanisms, most prominently tools known as privacy-enhancing technologies (PET), e. g. encryption, protocols for anonymous communications, attribute-based credentials, trusted computing, multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, data obfuscation, privacy infomediaries, and private search of databases (Mowbray and Pearson 2012; Encinas et al. 2015; Guasconi et al. 2018). The effectiveness of those privacy-enhancing technologies has already been demonstrated by researchers and in pilot implementations. However, apart from a few exceptions, for example, encryption for data in transit and in rest became widely used, privacy-enhancing technologies have not become a widely-used component in system design according to the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA 2018a, 2018b). Starting with IoT security issues in general, it can be noted as the general observation that Today s IoT devices are insecure and incapable of defending themselves. This is due to mainly the constrained resources in IoT devices, immature standards, and the absence of secure hardware and software design, development, and deployment. The efforts of defining a robust global mechanism for securing the IoT layers are also being hampered due to diversity of resources in IoT (Khan and Salah 2018). A number of authors analyze various aspects of IoT security, e. g. The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions pervasive, connected, and smart nodes interacting autonomously while offering all sorts of services. Wide distribution, openness and relatively high processing power of IoT objects made them an ideal target for cyber attacks. Moreover, as many of IoT nodes are collecting and processing private information, they are becoming a goldmine of data for malicious actors.",

Therefore, security and specifically the ability to detect compromised nodes, together with collecting and preserving evidences of an attack or malicious activities emerge as a priority in successful deployment of IoT networks (Conti et al. 2018). In this case authors also list the existing major security and forensics challenges within the IoT domain and briefly discuss some aspects of targeting identified challenges. Wide application of the IoT heavily influences the complexity of the problem, in particular due to fast technological advance in the field. For that reason some authors restrict their research of trends and open issues in IoT security to recent years, in order to provide a valid overview of the current state of IoT security research, the relevant tools, IoT modelers and simulators. binti Mohamad Noor and Hassan (2019) explain that the results of IoT failures can be severe, therefore, the study and research in security issues in the IoT is of extreme significance. The main objective of IoT security is to preserve privacy, confidentiality, ensure the security of the users, infrastructures, data, and devices of the IoT, and guarantee the availability of the services offered by an IoT ecosystem. Thus, research in IoT security has recently been gaining much momentum with the help of the available simulation tools, modelers, and computational and analysis platforms.

One such example related to multidisciplinary approach emphasizes that  as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and systems become more tightly integrated with our society (e. g. , smart city and smart nation) and the citizens (e. g. , implantable and insertable medical IoT devices), the need to understand, manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks becomes more pronounced  (Choo et al. 2021). In their special issue of the journal, Choo et al. try to cover topics of problem classification, detection, analysis, privacy issues and protection. Despite their efforts, in the conclusion they state that a number of challenges still remain to be addressed. Nevertheless, we present below the abstract of one paper from the special issue that deals with similar topics as this chapter. In  Proof of X-repute blockchain consensus protocol for IoT systems, researchers from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China, Shandong University of Science and Technology in China, Tencent Research Institute in China, Ch. Charan Singh University in India and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia designed a reputation-based consensus protocol for blockchainenabled IoT systems (Choo et al. 2021). One result of various initiatives and works, seriously motivated by the real need to find a practical solution to IoT security issues, is the  zerotrust. The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices to the Internet and the number is still increasing, which makes it very challenging to secure the applications, data, users, and devices in the complicated system. The zero-trust security has shown great potentials for IoTs which follows the  never trust, always verify  principle.",

    "content": "The zero-trust security has shown great potentials for IoTs which follows the  never trust, always verify  principle. In the past few years, the zero-trust security has attracted attentions from both industry and academics. The zero-trust holds the principle that every attempt to access the resources in IoT should be verified before granting the access (Li 2019). Due to its importance, zero-trust philosophy and networks have also caught the attention of large companies and institutions up to the governmental level. The USA, as often taking leadership in topics about technology, have published some guidelines regarding Zero-Trust Architecture. Zero-trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cyber-security paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero-trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero-trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero-trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i. e. , local area networks versus the Internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero-trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero-trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc. ), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource.",

This document contains an abstract definition of zero-trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero-trust could improve an enterprise s overall information technology security posture (Rose et al. 2020). Previously in this chapter we mentioned that the innovative approach might include Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), though with the original use, not relying on solutions which are already available. In the age of increasing digital interactions and analysis of user data, the concept of Self-Sovereign Identities has gained a large amount of interest. It promises its users more control and a more user-centric experience that, in contrast to previous user-centric efforts, does not have to rely on any centralised entities. The concept of verifiable claims has been extended by the Identity Registry Model as well as the Claim Registry Model. These decentralized registries were enabled by blockchain technology and although not a necessity the storage can be decentralised too. This only leaves the claim-issuers and their position of trust as centralised entities in the system (Mühle et al. 2018). Some SSI solutions are built upon blockchain technology as this already provides decentralized persistent data and consensus, but joining these two is not a must, as shown in some research. Both blockchain-based and other Self-Sovereign Identity solutions show to fulfill most of the evaluation criteria. The importance lies in the differences between solutions in both variants.",

Security and privacy protection with a zero-trust approach A zero-trust approach aims to provide a framework for a network of home hubs, mobile phones, cloud services and edge devices with advanced encryption and blockchain. The reference architecture is based on Pi Platform. Its design is recommended for private individuals and SMEs. With intrusion detection and a notification system, it will provide herd notification like with meerkats and herd immunity that will significantly increase Internet security. It provides communication infrastructure for users, services and IoT-enabled devices. The main objectives addressed by this approach are listed below: Security and privacy management for a big and heterogeneous volume of data: The nature and amount of data generated by users' devices need new processing mechanisms in order to achieve better security and data privacy, for example, selecting better encryption mechanisms for more sensitive user data. We need security and privacy management methods that can be rapidly deployed and do not rely on instantaneous data access and availability. Real-time and adaptive mechanisms for data protection: Real-time monitoring is a big challenge and an important factor to detect and react to any data security and privacy violation. The goal is put in practice by handling priorities and adaptive security mechanisms that are able to manage high data volumes, such as those produced by IoT devices.",

The goal is put in practice by handling priorities and adaptive security mechanisms that are able to manage high data volumes, such as those produced by IoT devices. Inter-site network security and data privacy management: User data are actually generated and available in different environments, such as at home when using a game console, mobile when connecting to their home manager, in the city when tracked by a security camera, at work when calling their meal provider, etc. Facilitating efficient collaboration between multiple secure platforms deployed in different places and in the cloud, gathering, protecting and securing data related to the same user will be a large challenge that needs to be investigated. Intrusion detection and proactive defence strategies techniques and tools: Novel intrusion detection mechanisms and defence strategies, mainly those based on artificial intelligence, should be included to produce a more robust platform against attacks. As shown in Figure 5. 2, the ZTA will base its approach on SSI and Pi Platform19. SSI means that the user IoT device will directly manage its personal information and control access over it. With SSI, the power to control personal data resides in the user and not in any third party granting or tracking access to these credentials. SSI is based on credentials: users have verifiable credentials of different personal information (information certified by trusted issuers, for instance, a manufacturer could provide a credential of production date for an IoT device so anyone could trust that credential as it was directly provided by the manufacturer).",

Case study: secure and private interactive intelligent conversational systems Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new horizons for IoT applications benefitting from the huge amount of data produced by IoT devices. However, software design has not yet evolved in order to propose new methods and measures that bring security and privacy to these new AIbased technologies. In this chapter, we are particularly interested in the user s interaction in the intelligent environment. We will focus on interactive intelligent conversational systems because they concern a large part of futuristic IoT applications and products, such as home assistants, robots and driving assistants. Interactive intelligent conversational systems leverage a number of heterogeneous components which are supposed to work seamlessly while maintaining a high level of responsiveness, robustness, accountability and data integrity. The simplest user case, consisting of asking  what is the weather doing today  implies a pipeline consisting of a DSP-based microphone array processor, a phonetic processing unit, a speech to text module, a natural language processor, a SAAS (Software As A Service) client capable of gathering the weather information, a natural language generator, a text to speech engine, and a behavior and animation controller capable of synchronising the movement of the GUI avatar with the output speech. On top of that, one needs to account for the fact that the speech to text and text to speech module might be deployed on the cloud and subject to potential data losses as well as malevolent data compromising.",

All these heterogeneous modules might be written in different languages and operate on different architectures and hardware, on desktop computers, embedded appliances or cloudbased servers. The paragraph above suggests an obvious first challenge: the heterogeneous nature of interactive dialog-based applications increases the complexity of deployment, testing and security assessment. The current chapter aims at answering these challenges by designing and proposing a set of relevant components and tools by means of security and data privacy according to the architecture presented in section 5. 5. To that end the following specific goals are set: (i) Establish measures for secure conversational systems in IoT, assuring the privacy of data from user interaction to the accomplishment of user request, (ii) Establish privacy procedures for the exchanged data, (iii) Formally specify modules and their composition to guarantee the functioning of a compound system, and finally, (iv) Show, via a scenario, how it works. We will use LinTO20 infrastructure as our primary field of study on interactive conversational systems for the case studies. LinTO is part of an industrial initiative to design a smart conversational assistant for companies. It includes a set of innovative features for individual or collective use. It is based on the French speech recognition engine in the advancement development phase at LINAGORA21.",

LinTO includes transcription services for simple commands and a large vocabulary. The standalone version is an embedded board with limited resources, a touch screen, speakers, a matrix of microphones and, according to the configuration, a panoramic camera can be plugged into the board. It is complemented by a software platform for conversational assistance that supports intelligent interaction modalities. More advanced deployment uses a functional LinTO platform stack running on a server and a LinTO client running on a device. The messages coming from the device are addressed to the platform using MQTT topics. The client could for example send an audio voice request to the server for further processing or stream an audio flux for live transcription. In contrast, server to client messages are used to control device behaviors such as speech synthesis and command execution. Currently, LinTO client is available for Raspberry Pi and Android.",

Such proper testing in the field would require a period of commercial use, besides case studies and pilots. Furthermore, a complex solution like this IoT system requires well-organized handling of the feedback from users in order to perform debugging, fine-tuning and possible updates. Some of the additional topics either directly connected to the proposed IoT solution or related to it in some way, might include: further enhancement of IoT data privacy, including accountability, verification of secure data origin and transparency of data; IoT secure information integrity; IoT emerging threats and risk management; IoT cybersecurity incident prevention, response and mitigation; physical security handling in IoT systems; enhancement of the system for IIoT (industrial Internet of Things) and Industry 4. 0; IoT surveillance issues, including legal aspects. The proposed IoT solution seems very promising so far and advanced encryption, SSI and block-chain have the power to overcome the limitations of the IoT with regard to data protection and privacy. At the same time, one must not forget that the very same advanced technology and block-chain have high computation requirements, restricted scalability, high bandwidth overhead and latency, making them overall unsuitable to the concept of IoT in their basic form. The Pi-based service provides an efficient block-chain implementation, but the optimization of processes in order to run efficiently in the IoT might show some tradeoff of which we are not aware at the present stage. Another aspect which cannot be predicted with certainty is the behavior and the acceptance of the proposed IoT solution by people.",

    "content": "Another aspect which cannot be predicted with certainty is the behavior and the acceptance of the proposed IoT solution by people. Besides the subjective attitude towards security (e. g. it will not happen to me  behavior) and potential issues with SSI that in essence passes the management of personal information to the user s IoT-device, there is also the problem of efficient standard testing and the presentation of results regarding the stability, performance, and security of the application. It is mandatory that a large number of people understand, accept and agree with the defined criteria. In this way, verification would be valid and users would have the motivation to use such blockchain based products. 5. 8. Conclusion Big enterprises and cloud service providers are collecting data about their users and limiting users' options and limiting the functionality of systems that their users use. Such huge data gatherings are an enviable target and hackers are gathering data as they break into systems built by companies that are collecting data with users' consent. A personal data breach may facilitate abuse by third parties, including cyberthreats such as coercion, extortion and corruption. According to the most recent IBM Security report, the average cost of a single data breach amounts to approximately 3. 86 million dollars. Customers' personally-identifiable information is the most frequently comprised type of record (80 per-cent of all breaches). In this work, we recommend the use of the zero-trust approach at all layers of the IoT infrastructure. In particular, we recommend to perform a centralized configuration and management of devices, to access the health of IoT devices in a continuous manner, monitor IoT devices for anomalous behaviors, protect privileged identities, and slice networks into segments to minimize the impact of a potential intrusion.",

In particular, we recommend to perform a centralized configuration and management of devices, to access the health of IoT devices in a continuous manner, monitor IoT devices for anomalous behaviors, protect privileged identities, and slice networks into segments to minimize the impact of a potential intrusion. We also stress the need for automation and artificial intelligence-based methods to detect and quickly respond to a possibly ongoing attack. The architecture presented in this chapter, advances the state of the art of usable security and privacy by proposing an application of selfsovereign identity (SSI) technology. With SSI, the power to control personal data resides with the user and not with any third party granting or tracking access to these credentials. Users can freely limit and share only the required personal information and for the required recipient. No prior agreement is needed and no intermediaries are needed: devices will securely exchange personal information directly between them. The result is more flexible, more secure, and more private personal information management. 5. 9.",

Introduction Home automation implementation relies on a medium that supports communication and cooperation between devices. To achieve the desired objectives, it is necessary to adopt an approach that guides the implementation and design of such a home. Smart home developers have solved many problems and addressed numerous issues to make the life easier through automation, or to help people (the elderly, children, people with disabilities) live a safe, independent life when necessary. However, many problems do not yet have solutions.

Cyber technology is now unavoidable in everyday life; note that wearable IoT devices, in relation to smart homes, have played a pioneering role in this technological revolution. The more people rely on this technology, the greater the risk of infiltration and data leakage. Thus, the greater the need to develop a cybersecurity infrastructure that protects these systems and their users, keeping in mind that it has now become clear that the IoT is vulnerable to many security breaches. Additionally, IoT devices produce huge volumes and assortments of data, with varying degrees of veracity. Accordingly, when big data innovations are introduced, better and better information processing can be achieved. Furthermore, as more devices become integrated into smart home solutions, the risk of attack increases, while securing smart home solutions becomes more challenging. It is well known that IoT and smart home devices have low computing power, custom architectures and very little memory and storage while security solutions require a certain level of performance to operate. It is hard to port to custom architectures and requires a considerable amount of memory and storage for databases.",

Cybersecurity experts have noticed an increasing trend towards machine learning-based solutions and most of them revolve around machine learning and deep learning techniques, especially if big data management is involved. This is because machine learning in cybersecurity looks for patterns in given data and requires very little computing power, memory and storage, it is easy to port to unknown architectures and it has the ability to send data to the cloud to analyze. This chapter consists of seven parts. In the first part we present the problems related to the security of the various devices connected in smart homes. In the second part, we present the state of the art on smart homes and connected objects. The third part explains the IoT architecture and its different layers. IoT security is presented in part four and, in part five, we look at artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and the difference between them. We also define deep learning and the importance of its application to cyber security in Smart Homes. Part six is devoted to human activity recognition in smart homes, using neural networks and deep learning. To conclude, we present several methods for detecting anomalies and attacks in smart homes. It is important to note that, when considering smart home network and device security for people with disabilities, we are dealing with a particularly sensitive topic in that it is related to human life and survival, and is not only about securing comfort and wellbeing. 6. 2.

These devices are not general purpose devices, such as smart phones and PCs, but dedicated function devices, such as retail vending machines, aircraft engines, smart cars, thermostats, wearable gadgets and a wide range of other examples (Hung 2017). Gartner also stated that, by 2020, more than 25  of identified attacks in enterprises would involve the IoT, and yet the IoT would account for less than 10  of IT security budgets (Panetta 2016). According to Kaspersky Labs, the number of malware samples for IoT devices has been increasing rapidly, from 3, 219 samples in 2016 to 121, 588 samples in 2018. It was made evident that there are a huge number of vulnerabilities within IoT devices (Kuzin et al. 2018). In 2016, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyber attack was launched, causing major disruption to Internet services that affected some of the most technologically important companies, including Amazon and Twitter. The cybercriminals behind the attack exploited the security weaknesses of thousands of IoT devices, allowing them to be hijacked and turned to be the sources of domain name system (DNS) requests that flooded traffic to the DNS hosting provider Dyn. It is worth bearing in mind that Dyn had DDoS countermeasures in place. The DNS provider, Dyn, stores log data that has been efficiently processed by big data technologies and analyzed using deep learning algorithms, to determine any type of anomalous behavior. With over 20 billion connected things expected to be in use by the end of 2020, it is highly likely that this kind of DDoS attack is just the beginning (Gassais et al. 2020).",

    "content": "2020). The increase in and spread of IoT devices has led to cyber security experts having to deal with new challenges, and it has widened the area of attack, starting with the smart home platforms themselves to the operating systems, communication media and the whole system in which it operates. This can lead to new types of attacks, such as denialof-sleep attacks that drain the batteries of devices. These challenges are very real as many manufacturers of smart home appliances are solely focused on functionality; security is a much lower priority for them and some are not equipped to secure their devices against cyber threats. In addition, many IoT devices do not have the supporting infrastructure to run security solutions or even have updating mechanisms and, most dangerous of all is consumer negligence2. Furthermore, smart home solutions consist of tens or hundreds of IoT devices on the same network (in most cases these are wireless). Rather alarmingly, most of these devices have little or no protection at the software and infrastructure levels. The technology that was the science fiction of yesterday has become the reality of today yet, at the same time, it is making us more vulnerable to attacks. We do not wish to demonize these solutions, but we believe that smart home and IoT security must be taken more seriously. On the other hand, smart home systems typically generate huge amounts of data from a wide range of sources and devices; these include sensors, situational data such as object locations, forecast data such as the weather, contextual data such as number of residents in the home, and operational data to manage the whole IoT system. These data must be converted into decisions and actions by suitable data science tools that are designed to work on big data.",

    "content": "These data must be converted into decisions and actions by suitable data science tools that are designed to work on big data. Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and high-variety information that requires innovative forms of information processing for decisionmaking. Traditionally, big data is characterized by six basic characteristics, commonly known as the 6Vs. In general, data is classified as big data if it fulfills the first 3Vs: volume, velocity and variety. Big data technologies are the tools that are used to efficiently process big data. Therefore, because the goal is to protect and secure substantial, highvalue systems, and because the risks are high and multiple, and because huge amounts of data have to be handled by the network, the weekly or monthly security analytics reports would not be sufficient to detect and mitigate the cyber attacks in real time. Defensive tools that are efficient and advanced to the same degree as the systems and the attacks are needed. In the recent past, most of us were used to having a laptop and a smartphone, each requiring the installation and maintenance of security solutions to protect them against attacks. Nowadays, some smart homes have more intelligent and interconnected devices than most medium-sized companies had some years ago. It becomes difficult to handle updates, passwords, settings, etc. for each of these devices. For this reason, we consider the importance of adopting deep learning technology to secure each smart home solution, which in turn secures the whole system. 6. 3.

In this chapter, we provide a clear idea of the IoT technology in smart homes by presenting the history, advantages and disadvantages, as well as the challenges of each. 6. 3. 1. IoT overview IoT is a network of interconnected devices and tools with advanced capabilities to interact with other devices and also with humans and their environment to perform a set of tasks (Bari et al. 2013). To do this, we use sensors with a transparent connection between devices and the physical world. The new IoT devices have a wide range of sensors (microphones, light sensors, gas detectors, etc. ) thus enabling more efficient applications (Lane et al. 2010). IoT devices can detect any change in their environment using sensors and take action to improve their operation (Suo et al. 2012); this has made it possible to make effective decisions. Communication between devices and the physical world has also made IoT devices operational in several fields of application (health, industry, household appliances, etc. ).

    "content": "). Indeed, the evolution of IoT tools has ensured the growth and development of the industry. To guarantee the success of IoT technology, security should be guaranteed and vulnerabilities should be resolved. As mentioned previously, IoT consists of four layers; guaranteeing security at each of these layers means we can achieve complete security in IoT (Li et al. 2016). IoT depends on collecting information from physical objects and presenting them to the user through services and applications. Healthcare is an example of IoT technology that collects personal information about a patient s health and transmits this to a healthcare system. Since a lot of personal information is collected, this information should be protected from unauthorized users to maintain people s privacy. The transportation of information should be protected from the sensor (source) to the application (destination) (Bertino 2016; Vyas et al. 2016). IoT connects millions of devices in order to collect information. As the number of devices increases, the amount of information collected increases, thus privacy threats increase (Abomhara and Koien 2015). To secure IoT, attacks should be prevented and security methods should be applied to prevent the vulnerabilities. Attackers will always target systems that have vulnerabilities, thus securing systems against attackers is the main goal because attackers are ever-present (Li et al. 2016) (Abomhara and Koien 2015). 6. 3. 2. History IoT has been through several important development stages (IbarraEsquer et al. 2017): 1969: the Internet was born out of the ARPANET project; 1971: the first embedded systems3 appeared with the Intel 4004; early '90s: the concept of ubiquitous computing was proposed by Mark Weiser; mid '90s: the development of sensor nodes, wireless communication and digital electronics began; 1999: the term IoT was first used. 6. 3. 3.

Subsequently, Roman et al. (2013) focus on the distributed approach for IoT and the challenges related to the security of this architecture. In 2014, an approach that describes challenges related to the security and privacy of IoT was presented. These challenges still need to be overcome in the coming years for maximum buy-in from all IoT stakeholders involved. Furthermore, a distributed capability-based access control mechanism was proposed, which is built on public key cryptography in order to cope with some of these challenges (Skarmeta et al. 2014). Nobakht et al. (2016) focus on an intrusion detection and a mitigation framework called IoT-IDM to provide network-level security. They used machine learning to create patterns for some known network-level attacks and demonstrated this with a real IoT device: the  smart light bulb. Aly et al. (2019) present an extensive description of security threats and challenges across the different layers of the architecture of IoT systems. In addition, they focus on the solutions and countermeasures proposed in the literature to address these security issues. Ahmad et al. (2019) focus on the modeling of the fog computing architecture and compare its performance to the traditional model. They present a comparative study with a traditional IoT architecture based on classifying applications, define a priority for each application, and use the cell operator as the main fog center to store data.",

Advantages, disadvantages and challenges Each piece of technology has its advantages, disadvantages and must overcome challenges in order to be usable, adaptable and secure for human use. The same goes for IoT (Yaakoub et al. 2019). 6. 3. 4. 1. Advantages The most important advantages of IOT are (Cognizant 2015; Sarmah et al. 2017; Soumyalatha 2019): communication: IoT provides machine-to-machine (M2M) communication through which devices can stay connected, allowing full transparency and better performance and quality; automation and control: by using IoT, a huge amount of data can be automated and controlled by machines without the need for human intervention. This produces faster and more timely results; saving time and money: money and time are saved by monitoring different aspects of life using sensors; new profit resource for businesses: the sale of connected devices and related services exceeded  200 trillion in revenue through 2020.",

The lack of standards that allow smart devices to connect and communicate as desired makes it difficult for organizations to integrate applications and devices; software complexity: software infrastructure is required to support the network that smart devices connect to, since the latter operate with minimal resources; storage: smart devices collect enormous amounts of data that require scalable data storage to be allocated; data interpretation: context interpretation is important to generate useful information, and to draw conclusions from the data sent by the sensor; security and privacy: protecting data collected by smart devices from unauthorized use or attack is a major concern.

IoT architecture The IoT architecture is composed of elements that fall into three categories: IoT hardware is composed of devices such as sensors; IoT middleware is composed of tools used for data storage and analytics; IoT presentation which is composed of tools used for data interception and visualization to keep track of various events occurring. These elements are represented as four main layers which are: the sensing layer, the network layer, the service layer and the applicationinterface layer (Leloglu 2017) (Table 6. 1. ). Table 6. 1.

First, there is the device-to-device communication model where devices communicate directly with one another using different types of networks. An example of this model is the smart home. Second, there is the device-to-cloud communication model where devices communicate with a cloud service using a wired or Wi-Fi connection. An example of this model is the smart TV. Third is the device-togateway communication model where devices communicate with the cloud service through the gateway. Finally, there is the back-end data sharing model where data is combined from different devices through multiple cloud services. 6. 4. 2. Network layer The network layer is between the sensing layer and the service layer. It defines the communication between the connected devices to transfer collected information to the service layer to be processed. 6. 4. 3. Service layer The service layer is between the network layer and the applicationinterface layer. It processes the information collected and saves it in the database for later use by the services that the user requires. 6. 4. 4. Application-interface layer The application-interface layer is between the service layer and the users. It is developed based on user requirements or industry specifications. At each layer there are multiple and various security risks that must be resolved. Therefore, each layer may have a different security solution for the information being collected from the devices before it reaches the application-interface layer, in order to achieve a totally secure system. 6. 5.

Examples of threats in this layer are: spoofing attacks, where the attacker masquerades as an IoT device and sends fake data; DoS attacks where the resource becomes unavailable to the users (Li et al. 2016). 6. 5. 2. Security in the network layer The second layer is the network layer which describes how IoT devices are connected and specifies the medium used. The network layer includes communication technology like ZigBee (Ning et al. 2013) and 3G 4G 5G wireless communications (Ejaz et al. 2016). The main concerns in this layer are: QoS of data being transmitted; network management according to the type of network; confidentiality of information; privacy and security of user sensitive data. The security requirements in this layer relate to overall security requirements, privacy leaks, communication security, fake network messages, overconnected devices, denial of service (DoS) and man-inthe-middle attacks. Many attacks can target the IoT communication protocols, such as eavesdropping against Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, etc. (Bapat et al. 2017). Eavesdropping and replay attacks are other common attacks in this layer (Vafaei 2014). Examples of threats in this layer include data breaches, where secure information is released to an untrusted environment, malicious code such as viruses, malware and Trojans. 6. 5. 3.

The security requirements in this layer are authorization, service authentication, group authentication, privacy protection and privacy leaks. Examples of threats in this layer are DoS attacks, unauthorized access to data, tampering with data, etc. (Atzori et al. 2010). 6. 5. 4. Security in the application-interface layer The fourth layer is the application layer where various applications are presented to the users. The main concerns in this layer are: confidentiality, authentication, authorization and integrity between layers; safe software downloading, secure remote management and isolation of sensitive data (Gu et al. 2014). The security requirements in this layer include sensitive information isolation, safe remote configuration, software downloading and updating, administrator authentication, a unified security platform, security patches, integrity and confidentiality for transmission between layers, cross-layer authentication and authorization, etc. Authorization is verifying the user has permission to access a resource. Examples of threats in this layer are: social engineering a very popular technique where an attacker obtains information from the users by tricking them, injection attacks, where an attacker executes the code on the server directly which causes data loss or data modification, distributed DoS, etc. (Ning et al. 2013). This four-layer infrastructure maintains total security for IoT to avoid connecting fake devices, capturing data generated by attackers, as well as other risks. If we compare the risks at each layer, we find that the common risks are DoS attacks, lack of authentication, authorization, data confidentiality and privacy 6. 5. 5.",

Cross-layer threats Information exchanged between the layers may be vulnerable to threats such as: sensitive information being transmitted from one layer to another; leakage of sensitive information at the boundaries of the layers; misconfiguration. The security requirements in this layer are security protection, privacy protection and trust (Li et al. 2016). 6. 5. 6. Security attacks Since IoT is susceptible to many threats and vulnerabilities, attacks occur in different layers and typically concern four aspects of security: secrecy, authentication, integrity and availability (Li and Da Xu 2017). Some examples of different attacks are presented below. 6. 5. 6. 1. DoS attack In this type of attack, an attacker tries to deny access to the resources and services which affect the availability of the services. DoS attacks involve requests and messages being sent to consume the resources of a certain device (Saadeh et al. 2016). 6. 5. 6. 2. Replay attack In this type of attack, an attacker intercepts the communication, copies the message, and sends it again impersonating the real sender. This leads to the theft or modification of messages being transmitted (Mahalle et al. 2013). 6. 5. 6. 3. Eavesdropping In this type of attack, an attacker only listens to the communication of data being transmitted between two parties but does not modify data, thus affecting the privacy of the data only (Saadeh et al. 2016). 6. 5. 6. 4.",

The research will focus on a systemic review of fog networks and platforms, determine the possible security gaps, analyze existing security solutions and list comprehensive solutions that can eliminate many potential security flaws within fog systems. Since each layer has different features and roles, each layer also has different security requirements (Figure 6. 1). Figure 6. 2 shows the six aspects of security requirements for the IoT framework which are: confidentiality, availability, privacy, authenticity, integrity and nonrepudiation. Confidentiality is needed to secure the data; availability ensures that the resources and data are accessible; privacy is needed to protect customer data; authenticity components ensure proof of identity; integrity is to guarantee the data is accurate and trusted; and finally, non-repudiation is needed to provide a trusted audit trail. All of these security challenges make the data vulnerable and exposed to an attacker (Li et al. 2016; Pal et al. 2020). To ensure security across the system, we work on a solution in each layer.

Security solutions in sensing layer To resolve the security problems and avoid attacks on IoT devices, four actions should be done: implement specific security standards for all IoT devices so all devices apply the same standards, in order to avoid loss of data in the event a device is replaced; build a trusted data sensing system to continue receiving data from trusted devices only; trace and identify the source of a user to ensure validity. These actions can be applied in two steps at the sensing layer. The first step is to ensure that the users are authorized and authenticated before accessing sensitive data. The second step is to apply security methods for IoT devices to ensure the data is collected and transmitted securely. To ensure the privacy of the data, there are multiple techniques applied according to the type of the data. For example, encryption, decryption and hashing techniques are applied on text data while a CRC (cyclic redundancy check) and image compression techniques are applied on images. For RFID devices, multiple techniques are applied such as cryptography, AES (advanced encryption standard) and hashing algorithms. For the integration of RFID devices and WSN nodes, new challenges arise such as user authentication, communication security, privacy and others. These techniques are applied when the devices are manufactured. Basic security protocols for communication are authentication, availability, confidentiality and integrity (Li et al. 2014; Pal et al. 2020). 6. 5. 8. 2.

For a color version of this figure, see www. iste. co. uk khatoun cybersecurity. zip Through machine learning, a system can perform a learning function with the data it ingests and thus it becomes progressively better. This learning is possible through the use of examples to improve some aspects of performance. The data is considered to be a set of training examples. The algorithms parse the training data, and use the individual training examples to see how well they can answer the question related to their goal. That answer is then analyzed and used to improve the algorithm s ability to give better answers in the future. This learning process is repeated for each example. In this way, each training example contributes a little bit to the accuracy or predictive power of the algorithm. If the learning process works, we say that the learning algorithm generalizes, meaning that its predictions are useful beyond the training examples (Wasicek 2018).

    "content": "3. Deep learning Over the last few years, deep learning has become a prominent arrangement of machine learning techniques dependent on learning data representation. It has become apparent that deep learning algorithms can beat best-in-class approaches in conventional AI issues such as picture and sound classification (Dean et al. 2012). Furthermore, it has been expressed that they may outperform humanlevel abilities in classifying these sorts of information (Sparks et al. 2013). Deep learning is a subsection of machine learning (and therefore of artificial intelligence) that is based on artificial neural network (ANN) models. The artificial neural network is an important programming paradigm. Previously, to make things easier for the computer, we split the big problems into small tasks. But, with neural networks, the computer has the ability to learn from training data in order to find the best solution. Since 2006, machine learning and deep neural networks have enabled deep learning. Deep learning provides better performance for certain problems like speech recognition and computer vision. Neural networks are clustering and classification tools of data that we store and manage, according to their similarities or their labeling. In addition, artificial neural networks have the possibility to make a predictive analysis to establish correlations between items. The word deep refers to the number of layers in neural networks. Deep learning currently plays a critical role in the development of highly automated systems. The notable advancement of deep learning is the result of three fundamental elements: the collection of huge amounts of data; the turn of events and openness of new AI structures and machine learning platforms (Abadi et al. 2016, pp. 265 283) and algorithms (Niu et al. 2011) because of advances in equivalent (Raina et al.",

Deep learning is based on a deep neural network. It is a subset of machine learning which is the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed, and it is a part of artificial intelligence, which is the engineering of intelligent machines and programs. Deep learning involves learning data representations by utilizing a network of multiple layers of nonlinear preparing units for different sorts of highlight extraction and change. Each layer s output is the successive layer s input. Generally, deep learning models and techniques endeavor to copy the movement in layers of neurons in the neocortex, for example, an artificial neural network. It learns, like other machine learning strategies, by iteratively grouping a preparation informational collection, and refreshing its boundaries marginally into the correct bearing each time a characterization error happens. Eventually, the tweaked boundaries of the algorithm are tried on an assessment informational collection to quantify the algorithm s performance. Such an algorithm works with the programmed classification of information which, when conveyed, eliminates the requirement for an individual to classify the information physically (Domingos 2012).

The purpose of HAR is to determine activities performed by one inhabitant or numerous inhabitants depending on various sensors that are prearranged and configured to notice and detect many events, for example movement sensors, pressure identifiers, RFID tags, electrical power analyzers (Belley et al. 2015), and more. The HAR cycle includes a few stages. The four primary stages are as follows (Figure 6. 7): Pre-processing: separating raw data from sensor streams to deal with inadequacy, remove noise and repetition, and perform data standardization and labeling. Feature extraction: separating features from raw data to utilize it as input to machine learning. Feature selection: reducing the number of features to improve their quality and lessen the computational effort required for classification. Classification: identifying the given activity using AI and machine learning. The general objective of the HAR framework is to replace all   or almost all   of the human tasks inside the home, either by predicting these activities and acknowledging them when important or by meeting the necessities and requirements predefined by the residents. For instance, with the assistance of sensory devices, a HAR framework can monitor the medical issues of an inhabitant and alert healthcare services in the event of an emergency.

Neural network algorithm for human activity recognition In the field of human activity recognition, neural networks have recently demonstrated a decent level of proficiency and precision in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. The first application using ANNs in a smart home environment was developed by Mozer (1998). This application, named ACHE (Adaptive Control of Home Environments) was able to adapt the environmental conditions (heating, lighting, ventilation and water heating) to the needs of residents and their level of comfort (Kasabov 2002). Jorge and Goncalves (2001) worked on automated monitoring of the health of the elderly using artificial intelligence tools. They collected data from the elderly regarding neurological disorders (loss of motor, sensory and cognitive abilities) via computer devices, with the aim of predicting the next activity (Elman 1990). Pigot et al. (2003) tried to minimize the risks resulting from actions taken by elderly people in a physical environment, both at a theoretical and practical level. The authors applied ANNs with other mathematical models to aid in the detection of models associated with risk (Pigot et al. 2003; Stefanov et al. 2004). Rivera-Illingworth et al. (2005) developed new connectionist architecture to recognize the behaviors of daily life (sleeping, eating, etc. ), using simple sensors and an intelligent algorithm (Augusto and Nugent 2006; Montana and Davis 2006).

Three kinds of learning algorithms are required (Hiregoudar et al. 2014): supervised neural networks, unsupervised neural networks and semi-supervised neural networks. A brief description of each of the three calculations is given in Table 6. 2. A typical neural network structure is shown in Figure 6. 8. ANNs can be categorized as either feed-forward networks or feedback networks, as shown in Figure 6. 5. Each learning algorithm is intended for preparing a particular architecture. Consequently, when we examine a learning algorithm, a specific network architecture affiliation is implied (Jain et al. 1996). In Fang et al. (2014) back-propagation (BP) is utilized to prepare the feed-forward neural network for human activity recognition. This algorithm was compared with another probabilistic algorithm: the Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The outcomes show that neural networks that make use of BP calculation generally have better human movement acknowledgment exhibitions than the NB classifier and the HMM. In Mehr et al. (2016), quick propagation (QP), the LevenbergMarquardt (LM) algorithm and batch back propagation (BBP) have been used for human action recognition and compared alongside execution on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) smart home dataset. The accomplished outcomes showed that the LM algorithm has better human activity recognition execution (92. 81  accuracy) than QP and BBP algorithms.

They used the data collected (walking, running and resting) of the triaxial accelerometer from smart mobile phones. The speed of the activity has three parameters x, y and z which are transformed into vector magnitude information. These contribute to the learning of the 1D CNN. This technique had 92. 71  accuracy. The accuracy of a neural network is based on the nature of the different characteristics, supervised exercises and limitations. Hussein et al.

Their system is designed to monitor the elderly and people with disabilities so as to bring them more security and safety without disrupting their lives. Their behavior and living habits are recorded using a multisensory system. Learning and adapting to the habits of this group of people is achieved by introducing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to the output of this system. Thus, any sudden change can be analyzed.

Deep neural networks used in human activity recognition Lately, there has been developing revenue in deep learning techniques. It has become a basic exploration region in human activity recognition, natural language processing, machine interpretation and environmental monitoring (Guo et al. 2014). Deep learning is an overall term for neural network methods which depend on taking in portrayals from raw data and contain more than one hidden layer. The network has numerous layers of non-linear data processing for feature extraction and change. Each progressive layer utilizes the output from the previous layer as input. Deep machine learning algorithms include restricted Boltzmann machines, auto-encoders, sparse coding, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (Figure 6. 9). These deep learning strategies can be stacked into various layers to frame deep learning models that give improved framework execution, adaptability, robustness and eliminate the need to rely upon conventional handcrafted features (Nweke et al. 2018). These methods are applied to activity of daily living (ADL) (Hassan et al. 2018), like locating and detecting posture in Abdel-rahman et al.

    "content": "Zhang et al. (2015) combined HMM and DNN models to perceive activity. Be that as it may, there is at present no preferred deep learning method for human activity. This is likely because of the changeability of human practices, activities performed, types of sensors utilized and includes selection received. The calculations of neural networks are based on modeling of the characteristics of the human brain. This leads to a relationship being formulated between the input and output variables on the basis of the observable data. The general model of the neural network consists of: examining a process in neurons; data interaction; multiplying the weights of connections for data transferred from one neuron to another to solve problems; calculating the output using the enable function at input. The different categories of the neural network are shown in Figure 6. 10. Figure 6. 10. Feed-forward and feedback network architectures 6. 8. Anomaly detection in smart homes 6. 8. 1. What are anomalies? There are several definitions for the anomaly. An anomaly refers to any phenomenon that deviates from what is considered normal6. Anomalies are data patterns that do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior (Chandola et al. 2007). Anomaly detection or outlier detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data (Arthur and Erich 2017). 6. 8. 2. Types of anomaly Anomalies are classified into three types. Point anomalies: this is the case where an individual data instance is considered abnormal compared to the rest of the data. Contextual anomalies: this is an anomalous data instance in a specific context; it is also called a conditional anomaly (Song et al. 2007).",

Point anomalies: this is the case where an individual data instance is considered abnormal compared to the rest of the data. Contextual anomalies: this is an anomalous data instance in a specific context; it is also called a conditional anomaly (Song et al. 2007). Collective anomalies: when a collection of linked data instances is abnormal with respect to the dataset, this is the case of a collective anomaly. 6. 8. 3. Categories of anomaly detection techniques An instance of data is said to be normal or abnormal according to the labels associated with this instance. Anomaly detection techniques operate in one of three modes, depending on the availability of labels. Unsupervised anomaly: for an unlabeled dataset, unsupervised anomaly detection techniques assume that the majority of instances in the dataset are normal and look for instances that do not match the rest of the data. Supervised anomaly: detects anomalies in a dataset that has been labeled as  normal  and  abnormal  and involves the training of a classifier. Semi-supervised anomaly: this detection technique assumes that the training data has instances labeled only for the normal class. For this, these techniques are more widely applicable than the supervised techniques. 6. 8. 4. Related work of anomaly detection in smart homes The detection of anomalies has been the subject of several studies in the last ten years. In what follows, we present some works that have dealt with the problems of anomaly detection. In Stenudd (2010), the authors describe the concept of anomaly detection, used to monitor the behavior of the system to detect normal events from anomalies.

In Stenudd (2010), the authors describe the concept of anomaly detection, used to monitor the behavior of the system to detect normal events from anomalies. It is very useful for security in smart systems, especially for intrusion detection. It is done by comparing the current behavior of the system with previously-stored normal behavior. The anomaly detection helps in detecting insider attacks, is difficult for an attacker to set an alarm off, able to detect known and unknown types of attacks and it fits all deployment environments. But, the authors suggested training the system before deployment to determine the normal behavior, the system generates a false alarm and sometimes users can gradually train the system to accept anomalous behavior as normal. The research (Jakkula and Cook 2011) aims to detect anomalous events or actions in a smart home. The model starts with environmental sensing by collecting data from inhabitants and their environment to model it. The captured events are associated with timestamps, and then they used with the history of recognized sensor events to reveal patterns with frequent activity. The collected data contains five parameters: date, time, sensor ID, message and annotation. The system uses the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) which is quite popular for anomaly detection problems. The authors proposed a solution for this problem by estimating a function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement S. The algorithm can be summarized as mapping the data into a feature space H using an appropriate kernel function and then trying to separate the mapped vectors from the origin with maximum margin.",

The algorithm can be summarized as mapping the data into a feature space H using an appropriate kernel function and then trying to separate the mapped vectors from the origin with maximum margin. Once transformed to a different space, the data points which are closer to the origin are identified as an anomaly and reported (Figure 6. 11). The research was the initial step in the anomaly detection system and used to start from a new perspective with advanced features. In Ramapatruni et al. (2019) the authors work on a smart home equipped with many sensors. They presented some anomaly detection models for smart home security. The sensors are connected to the Internet through a wireless router and the data from the home. Data is sent to the gateway. The installation is modulated to add a data set collection machine, by configuring a port on the router dedicated to copying all the packets sent through the gateway to the data collection machine. The idea started by creating a model using hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner 1989) to learn common behavior in the smart home. The model takes into consideration many parameters like the number of the state as an N and the set of states represented by S corresponding to each sensor individually when used. Then, the different sensors are named with the capitalized first letter of each name like the min door sensor named as (MD). The value of sensors is on or off. Also, the M parameter is the number of unique observations possible for each state in S. The set V denotes the set of all possible observations in it.",

The first condition is during the presence of an individual in the house who uses the sensor in real-time. The results show 96. 8  of data values were stated as normal behavior. The net experiment performed using modified k-fold cross-validation to determine the efficacy of their approach in a general setting. The accuracy ranged from 95  to 98. The second condition tested was where there is no user in the smart home. The HMM model detected 97  of the attack anomalies. Figure 6. 11. Data points identified as anomaly detection In Yamauchi et al. (2020), they work on a new model of anomaly detection related to human behavior by focusing on a specific pattern of usage for users, in this research the work was done on smart home conditions. The anomaly detection learns from the repeated pattern, for example for a specific user on a cold day they turn the heater first then turn the humidifier then the model will detect another behavior if the order of action is changed. The model starts by learning events and then creates the sequence. After this, the model starts monitoring the sequence of events that happen and compares it to the learned one.",

The model learns through three phases: learning model, learning user behavior and detection. The learning model depends on the condition and user behavior. The first step is to define conditions, the sensor reading and place the condition in the table. In addition, for every condition, they stored the related human behavior. Now learning user behavior is done on the gateway by sorting sequences of events and differentiating between events from the users and events from guests that may be in the same house with the users. This is done by focusing on frequently repeated events that are most likely done by users. In the last phase, detection, the gateway recognizes the executed operations and then compares them to the learning events. After the three phases, the model can detect whether the behavior or the events is normal behavior or an attack. The tested result shows a 90  pass in detecting the attack. In Fu et al. (2021), the research focuses on appified smart homes, a term that refers to the smart home that uses many IoT devices and is connected to a different platform to control events in homes using smart applications. They proposed a Home Automation Watcher HAWatcher, which relies on semantic and logs events and then creates a hypothetical correlation according to semantic information and verifies them with events logs. For example, human activity changes device state then the device state also reflects human activities.",

For example, human activity changes device state then the device state also reflects human activities. The proposed model aims to determine the malfunctions in IoT devices if they are related to the network or technical part and is known as cyber, or physical which is related the device itself. Nevertheless, the model must detect whether it is a malfunction or an attack on the IoT devices. The model executes two steps: extract semantic from the smart app then converts it to correlation. They designed a shadow execution engine for anomaly detection. The role of this engine is to get access to internal device data and perform the tests on incoming events. The model faces some limitations such as deviation in human activity, false alarm rate and an attacker with knowledge of correlations, however it detected 62 real-world anomaly cases with high accuracy. In Gassais et al. (2020), the authors propose a new framework for intrusion detection that combines machine learning, the space of the user and kernel to detect intrusion in smart devices. The framework installs a whole new infrastructure consisting of sensors, actuators and an analysis system. Smart devices running the tracers and the analysis system detect anomalies by aggregating the collected traces. The framework triggers an alarm when intrusion is detected. It also can be developed to correlate traces and take actions to prevent the intrusion. The framework was tested on many algorithms and the results show different efficiency on different algorithms. It is very useful, however for detecting attacks on the system especially in eavesdropping attacks which are very difficult to detect using network information only.",

The Internet of Things allows devices and sensors in a smart environment (such as smart homes) to communicate with each other and share information between platforms. However, the IoT has proven to be susceptible to security vulnerabilities. It was therefore necessary to develop solutions capable of detecting anomalies and solving security problems. Because of this, in this section, we presented some studies that attempted to provide an overview of anomaly detection research. 6. 9. Conclusion In this chapter, we have highlighted the importance of cyber security in home automation using IoT devices, as well as the problems related to the security of the different devices connected in smart homes. The main challenge of smart home systems is the ability to adapt to the user by providing enhanced comfort, control and security. One of the most commonly-used methods for learning in a smart home system is neural networks. These are enhanced by deep learning which allows the use of a vast amount of data with minimal storage cost and has the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In this chapter, we have also explained the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning and how they differ. We have highlighted the importance of deep learning applications in cyber security and human activity recognition in smart homes using neural networks and deep learning. In a smart home, many devices are connected to the Internet and therefore can experience problems and can be the target of cyber attacks. These attacks can cause serious problems and harm users.",

For certain use cases it is desirable to make sensitive data (e. g. medical information or personal address) globally accessible (a) to authorized users only and (b) to data processing units through the Internet. Even seemingly inconspicuous data, such as the energy consumption measured by a smart meter, can lead to potential infringements on the users' privacy, e. g. by allowing an eavesdropper to conclude whether or not a user is currently at home. From an industry perspective, there is a pressing need for security solutions, especially for the transmission of sensitive data, and access to it has increased. Due to leaks of such information to the public, endusers in the private sector have also demanded security for their data and require privacy support and data ownership rights. From a legal perspective, this is addressed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; Regulation (EU) 2016 679) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union 2016).",

Regarding the infrastructure of the IoT, including devices with different amounts of resources, security risks are aggravated by the trend toward a separation of sensor network infrastructure and applications (ETSI 2010; Leontiadis et al. 2012). Therefore, a true end-to-end security solution is required to reach an adequate level of security for IoT. Protecting data once it leaves a local network is not sufficient, because it may reach the final destination after many jumps and via an uncontrollable network. However, the IoT is no longer limited to servers, routers, and computers. The IoT also includes constrained (tiny) devices   sensor nodes   limited in memory (app. 10 50 kByte RAM and 100 256 kByte ROM), computational capacity and power (a few AAA batteries) (Bormann et al. 2020). Those limited resources still demand end-to-end security support as requested by data owners, including the mutual authentication of communication partners (source and destination - sensor node, gateway, aggregator), which requires individual key agreements and a secured communication solution to be built between them. When explicitly depending on the resources of these devices, performing authentication and key agreement is challenging, because memory, computational capacity and energy are scarce. Furthermore, a deployed network may be dynamic, such that nodes dynamically join or leave, and require updates in security. Thus, a light-weighted solution is required, as represented by the described solution  sTiki  working under Contiki 3. 0. 7. 1.

The IoT used to be to limited to Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architectures (Gerke et al. 2003), networks, dedicated applications (Mischke and Stiller 2003) and devices, such as servers, computers, and routers. However, the IoT now includes wireless sensor devices that form an individual Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Those devices present a challenge for developers, because they are limited in memory, energy and computational capacity. In order to connect them to the Internet, they must support IP (Internet Protocol), which is often provided by using an IPv6 implementation called 6LoWPAN (Shelby and Bormann 2011). The topology of WSNs can range from star topologies to pure P2P topologies, but a combination of both is employed in WSN deployments. This means that the network consists of Full-Function Devices (FFD) and Reduced-Function Devices (RFD). Both of these types of devices can support different functionalities depending on their location within the WSN, ranging from simple data collection and forwarding to preprocessing. The communication between devices in a WSN is performed wirelessly, using the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The transmitted packet size is limited (e. g. 127 Byte), however existing IPv6 implementations, like 6LoWPAN, support packet fragmentation and compression in order to connect such limited devices to the IoT (Karl and Willig 2007). While many use cases for the IoT involve the collection and transmission of sensitive data, many deployments currently do not protect this data through suitable security schemes (Sen 2009).",

Different end-to-end security schemes were built upon existing Internet standards, specifically the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, but are not applicable to WSNs due to the use of constrained devices with especially limited memory resources. By relying on an established standard, existing implementations, engineering techniques, and security infrastructures can be reused to enable a security uptake from application developers (Kothmayr et al. 2013). The challenge is now to bring standards-compliant security to resource constrained sensor nodes in an end-to-end security architecture, fulfilling the request to be light-weight. While the intended solution must satisfy the paradigm of end-to-end security, it has to be based on standards and support mutual authentication (e. g. Luk et al. 2007; Kothmayr et al. 2013; Lowack 2013). It should be taken into account, that the new solution must be able to process the basic functionality of the existing implementation in parallel, especially when gathering data, transmitting it using the TinyIPFIX (Schmitt et al. 2017) format and supporting aggregation in the network (Sgier 2016, 2017). Furthermore, flexibility concerning network updates (e. g. node addition or deletion) is key in order to establish efficient and secure communication within the network. Such a light-weight solution that has been developed is  sTiki, working under Contiki 3. 0 as an operating system.

Symmetric encryption provides data integrity and a message counter guarantees the freshness of the messages received. For encryption, a multitude of algorithms were considered and compared, with AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard) coming out on the top. Finally, confidentiality is achieved by using a Message Authentication Code (MAC). The implementation performed consumes about 4. 5 kB of ROM and around 400 B of RAM, which allows sTiki to run on very constrained devices. sTiki was demonstrated to work and was tested successfully in multiple setups, including scenarios where certain nodes could not support sTiki. Combining sTiki with unencrypting nodes does work, even in case of heterogeneous hardware. It is, obviously, not possible to move from encrypted nodes back to unencrypted ones. The remainder of this chapter1 is structured as follows: section 7. 2 illustrates the Internet s history leading to the current connected world, while section 7. 3 presents insights of security for the IoT, and section 7. 4 paves the way toward the security protocol  sTiki, developed for constrained devices. Section 7. 5 covers the constraints of developing software for sensor networks, the architecture chosen, and the choice of AES. The implementation of sTiki is discussed in two environments. Finally, section 7. 6 evaluates the implementation and compares it to existing implementations, before conclusions are drawn. 7. 2.

Definitions and history of IoT During the late 1970 s the idea emerged to interconnect different networks in order to enhance the communication between universities and research facilities. The purpose of this connection was two-fold: (1) a simple exchange of knowledge using file sharing and (2) using the computational capacity of computer centers worldwide. This approach resulted in the Arpanet. Over the next decades more networks were connected, building the Internet, which was commercialized in 1990. As described in Kurose and Ross (2016) the Internet is defined as a network of networks with a specific infrastructure. Many networks operate as Autonomous Systems (AS), with one or more edge devices (gateways, routers and access points) responsible for forwarding traffic between different ASes Kurose and Ross 2016). Compared to other network participants, such as computers or servers, only a reduced OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) protocol stack is supported. This stack enables the forwarding of messages within an AS and between different ASes, even translation between different communication standards used on the physical layer (PHY) are possible. During the last few decades the connectivity of devices used increased, due to stakeholders' requests to be connected all over the world using manifold devices, and with them manifold communication technologies. This is referred to as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The term IoT was first coined by Kevin Ashton at a presentation at Proctor   Gamble in 1999 (Ashton 2009).",

According to Ashton, the IoT is a network of connected physical and fingerprintable objects (things) with a virtual representation in an Internet-similar structure. This definition still holds today, with the only exception that the connected device characteristics have changed over time. In the beginning only routers, hat ways, servers, and PCs were intended to be part of IoT, but new devices with specific and different characteristics have since been added. These new devices show the following characteristics (Schmitt 2019): (a) device size ranging from coin size to commonly used notebooks over smart devices, smart phones, and tablets, (b) devices support communication standards such as 3G to 5G and wireless communication, (c) devices are resource-constrained concerning energy, memory, and computational capacity, and (d) devices potentially require application specific (e. g. sensor devices, navigation systems, or alarm system) implementations and deployments. The existing diversity of devices shows that establishing connectivity between them may be challenging due to their characteristics, and may become even more complex when data formats, data transmission frequency, and requested support by stakeholders in terms of security and privacy are needed.

NOTE 1   Through the exploitation of identification, data capture, processing and communication capabilities, the IoT makes full use of things to offer services to all kinds of applications, whilst ensuring that security and privacy requirements are fulfilled. NOTE 2   From a broader perspective, the IoT can be perceived as a vision with technological and societal implications. EU-Parliament Briefing (Davis 2016): The Internet of Things (IoT) has been defined in a number of different ways. Generally speaking, it refers to a global, distributed network (or networks) of physical objects that are capable of sensing or acting on their environment, and able to communicate with each other, other machines or computers. Such  smart  objects come in a wide range of sizes and capacities, including simple objects with embedded sensors, household appliances, industrial robots, cars, trains, and wearable objects, such as watches, bracelets or shirts. Their value lies in the vast quantities of data they can capture and their capacity for communication, supporting real-time control or data analysis that reveals new insights and prompts new actions.

CIA triad   confidentiality, integrity, and availability (Andress and Winterfeld 2014; Summers and Tickner n. d. )) due to applications, environments and end-user requests linked with the resources of included devices in the network and the communication standards used. These changes in security paradigms become obvious when extending common IP networks with constrained networks building the IoT today. Constrained networks show common characteristics with IP networks, especially in relation to security fundamentals (sometimes also named cryptographic properties), following the CIA triad   confidentiality, integrity, and availability   and enhancing it with data freshness and authentication (Boyd and Mathuria 2010). Whereas, confidentiality ensures that data is only available to those that are authorized to obtain it, integrity ensures that no message can be altered by an entity as it traverses from the sender to the recipient, and availability ensures that the service of a constrained network is always available, even in the presence of internal or external attacks (e. g. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack). This triad is enhanced by data freshness, which implies that the data is recent and ensures that no adversary can replay old messages and authentication, which ensures the identity of the communication partners.",

Literature adds three additional security fundamentals (Boyd and Mathuria 2010; Eckert 2014): data origin authentication guarantees the origin of data, in order to archive entity authentication in protocols and establish keying material. Non-repudiation ensures that entities cannot deny sending data that they have committed to. Finally, resilience represents the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation. In addition, further security fundamentals become essential for the assumed use case of constrained networks, due to their deployment options (random, fixed, partly fixed) (Karl and Willig 2007). Selforganization is required in a constrained network due to the dynamic nature of it, which makes it impossible to deploy any pre-installed shared key mechanism between several nodes. Secure localization is also necessary to locate each constrained device accurately and automatically if faults should be detected. Finally, time synchronization is needed for collaborative constrained networks or certain security mechanisms, such as periodic updates of keying material. Figure 7. 2. Attack types in IP networks (Schmitt 2019) As constrained networks like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are part of the Internet and are constructed out of constrained devices that usually have limited resources, they represent a criticality in the IoT. As highlighted in Figure 7. 2, common attacks on constrained devices with a sensor device are (a) attacks against service integrity, (b) attacks on secrecy and authentication, and (c) attacks on authorization and authentication (i. e. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks) (Shi and Perrig 2004; Wang et al. 2006; Boyd and Mathuria 2010; Eckert 2014).",

Hence, the following provides an overview of the most relevant security analysis guidelines, followed by the description of a threat modelling for the security analysis of solutions available. Based on this knowledge gained about the IoT, the security insights combined with security expectations lead to the definition of sTiki. 7. 3. 1. Security analysis guidelines Before deploying protocols, algorithms, workflows, frameworks, and services or integrating them into commercial services and systems, they need to undergo a security analysis to check if they follow the security paradigms applied and requested by end users. For a security analysis, different guidelines apply to different application areas and developments (see section 7. 3. 1).

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several recommendations, the most important of which are the  Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers  published 2006 and the  Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment  from 2008. The first recommendation provides: a broad overview of information security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish and implement an information security program. The topics within this document were selected based on the laws and regulations relevant to information security. . . The purpose of this publication is to inform members of the information security management team (agency heads; chief information officers (CIOs); senior agency information security officers (SAISOs), also commonly referred to as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs); and security managers) about various aspects of information security that they will be expected to implement and oversee in their respective organizations. In addition, the handbook provides guidance for facilitating a more consistent approach to information security programs across the federal government. Even though the terminology in this document is geared toward the federal sector, the handbook can also be used to provide guidance on a variety of other governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements (Bowen et al. 2006).",

It presents technical testing and examination methods and techniques that an organization might use as part of an assessment, and offers insights to assessors on their execution and the potential impact they may have on systems and networks. For an assessment to be successful and have a positive impact on the security posture of a system (and ultimately the entire organization), elements beyond the execution of testing and examination must support the technical process. . . . The information presented in this publication is intended to be used for a variety of assessment purposes. For example, some assessments focus on verifying that a particular security control (or controls) meets requirements, while others are intended to identify, validate, and assess a system s exploitable security weaknesses. Assessments are also performed to increase an organization s ability to maintain a proactive computer network defense. Assessments are not meant to take the place of implementing security controls and maintaining system security. Following these recommendations, the target organizations of developments are requested (1) to establish an information security assessment policy, (2) implement a repeatable and documented assessment methodology, (3) determine the objectives of each security assessment, and (3) tailor the approach accordingly, analyze findings and develop risk mitigation techniques to address weaknesses (Scarfone et al. 2008).",

One of the most well known ones is the so-called  OWASP Application Security Assessment Standards Project. Its mission is: to establish common, consistent methods for application security assessments standards that organizations can use as guidance on what tasks should be completed, how the tasks should be completed and what level of assessment is appropriate based on business requirement. . . . The final goal is to integrate a set of OWASP projects into an Application Security Assessment process in order to define a model which can be used by an organization to provide application security through OWASP standards. (OWASP Application Security Assessment Standards Project 2014) Due to the continuous growth of technology and attack possibilities (see Web Application Security Consortium (2004) and The Open Web Application Security Project (2019)) the specification of security analysis is undergoing updates periodically, in order to recommend effective prevention and countermeasures. Currently, the following information security assessment types are commonly used and recommended to define and design appropriate solutions for applications: A vulnerability assessment counts towards the technical assessments. Its purpose is to yield as many vulnerabilities as possible in an environment, along with severity and remediation priority information. Penetration tests count towards the technical assessments as well and target a specific goal to identify vulnerabilities. Common target vectors are stealing customer data or gaining administrative access to an infrastructure. An audit can either be technical and or document-based. It focuses on how an existing setup or configuration matches standards that need to be followed. Classic examples are who has access to a server, how often access rights are checked and if required revoked, and which backup procedure is implemented.",

Classic examples are who has access to a server, how often access rights are checked and if required revoked, and which backup procedure is implemented. A risk assessment is recommended to be performed periodically and aims to determine what the current level of acceptable risks is, measuring the current risk level, and then determining what can be done to bring these two in line where there are mismatches. A threat assessment focuses more on physical attacks than on the technology used. The main purpose is to determine whether a threat is credible or not and to identify how many resources are required to address the threat. 7. 3. 2. Security analysis by threat models In addition to the aforementioned guidelines and recommendations mentioned it also became practice to discuss the security of protocols in the context of a threat model. The result of a threat model depends on the exact specification of the attacker analysis, and it is essential to be precise. The most used approach is the Dolev-Yao security model (Dolev and Yao 1983), which gives a formal definition of the strongest possible attacker. It is often used in the security evaluation of protocols and assumes that the attacker is in control of all of the communication channels. In particular, the attacker may carry out any of the following (Dolev and Yao 1983): Eavesdropping assumes that the attacker may eavesdrop on any communication in the network. Further it can be assumed that they have recorded all prior communication between any two nodes. Message insertion assumes that the attacker knows the protocol specifications and can create and insert new messages at will.",

Message insertion assumes that the attacker knows the protocol specifications and can create and insert new messages at will. Message delay and delete assumes that the attacker may delay any message in the network, or even delete it. Message modification assumes that attackers can modify intercepted messages. Replays and out-of-order messages assumes that the attacker can replay any previously sent messages, and they can also forward them out of order. Attempt at impersonation assumes that the attacker may attempt to act under the identity of another principal. Old session keys assume that the attacker is in possession of session keys from older protocol sessions. Disabling the network assumes that the attacker may flood the network with messages, or partially or completely disable it ( cut the wire ) at any time. This is a capability against which a protocol cannot take measures. Protocols can only be designed to raise the barriers for the attacker as high as possible. Note that the attacker may be a legitimate user of the network (i. e. they may act under their own identity). The attacker is, however, bounded by the strength of the cryptographic primitives  encryption and signatures. They cannot decrypt messages and they cannot forge signatures or message authentication codes without the knowledge of the corresponding key. This effectively results in secure channels on which the attacker cannot modify messages without tampering being detected, but they may still be able to suppress messages and interact with the normal protocol flow.

The rationale of using this model is as follows: first, it is one of the standard models in the security community, and is well understood. Second, it is reasonable to design a protocol that is secure against the strongest possible attacker because in many cases we cannot be entirely sure of the capabilities of an attacker. Third, current model checkers for cryptographic protocols, such as AVISPA or Scyther, use the Dolev-Yao model internally (Cremers et al. 2009). Model checkers have become an important method for evaluating the security of protocols and finding attack vectors. It is important to observe that the Dolev-Yao model is a model for the formal analysis of a given system. It restricts the attacker to attack vectors within the system. Therefore, it does not cover attacks outside of the system, like social engineering or errors in an implementation that lead to secret information being compromised. The Dolev-Yao model was implemented into tools to automate the analysis of security protocols. The most common used tool nowadays is AVISPA2 (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications). Its design is inspired by common software design following the push-botton strategy for the automated validation of Internet security sensitive protocols and applications. It gives the developers of protocols the possibility to specify their protocols and assumed security properties with the help of a modular and expressive formal language.",

The tool integrates different backends, allowing the implementation of a variety of state-of-the-art automatic analysis techniques, which are applied on the developer s input. 7. 3. 3. sTiki s security expectations As depicted above, four security fundamentals exist, but not all may be needed or desired: (a) confidentiality, (b) integrity, (c) authentication, and (d) freshness. Authentication and integrity can both be achieved by using a cryptographic checksum, commonly called a Message Authentication Code (MAC). Freshness is usually provided by timestamps, nonces or counters. Confidentiality is achieved by encryption. In order to achieve all four, decisions must be made: the first decision is made between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, as there are arguments in favour of both. As in many decisions with WSNs, this one too is between efficiency and security. Asymmetric ciphers win in security, but take significantly more resources (Mohd et al. 2015). For example, ECC (asymmetric) is about 100 1000x slower than AES (symmetric) (Potlapally et al. 2003; Eisenbarth et al. 2007). For the planned use cases, symmetric will be fine and will also allow a better comparison to Lowack (2013). The second decision is made between block and stream ciphers. Block ciphers encrypt blocks of a fixed size, whereas stream ciphers encrypt data of arbitrary length. Research about lightweight cryptography focuses mainly on block ciphers because they can also be used for computing MACs, and if necessary, can be turned into stream ciphers by using CBC (Chain-Block Chaining) or Counter mode (Mohd et al. 2015).",

As a result of this, the most high quality lightweight ciphers are block ciphers and when using one, the implementation of an additional cipher for computing MACs can be omitted, which is also why a block cipher is used here. Mohd et al. (2015) compared many lightweight symmetric block ciphers for various criteria. In addition to these ciphers compared, a new ultra lightweight block cipher called QTL (Li et al. 2016) was considered, but Çoban et al. (2017) and Sadeghi et al. (2017) have proven it to be insecure. Lightweight ciphers are a specialized category of encryption algorithms that try to find a good trade-off between resource consumption and security. They are commonly used in WSNs, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), and other medical devices (Mohd et al. 2015). The power consumption is especially a concern. Because of the various security requirements of different applications (controlling a pacemaker vs. a home temperature monitoring system), different algorithms and variations exist. Comparing different ciphers reveals that no universally accepted metric exists for measurements; security is not a well-defined term (Mohd et al. 2015). In addition, new and innovative ways of attacking highly rated algorithms may be discovered and render the ratings useless.

Instead, AES shows up close to the top for almost all metrics used in Mohd et al. (2015) and Potlapally et al. (2003), which makes it a relatively obvious choice. Its major problem is its relatively large memory footprint. But many hardware boards (including OpenMote) offer a hardware-implementation of AES, which requires almost no additional memory. The most popular implementation is AES-128. Based on the results as of Mohd et al. (2015), Tea xTea would have been the second choice. Even though the parameters of the hardware implementation of the OpenMote B platform selected (see section 7. 4. 1) cannot be changed, it is still required to understand the impact on energy consumption, in order to judge potential alternatives. The main parameters of block ciphers are key-size, block-size, and the number of rounds performed. The increase in energy consumption is roughly linear to key-size and the number of rounds (Potlapally et al. 2003). The main parameters, however, do not have the largest impact on energy consumption. Instead, the mode of operation has an impact that is two to three times larger (Potlapally et al. 2003). This is because the different modes run different procedures to determine the key for the next encryption step, which can be a substantial effort. 7. 4.

Background knowledge for sTiki This section covers the most important technologies influencing the development of the proposed security protocol sTiki, which is designed for a subfield of IoT, namely WSNs. Such networks consist of just a few or up to thousands of small, very limited computers, normally called nodes or constrained devices. The nodes are usually battery powered and their memory is very limited, often measured in kB. Their purpose is to gather data, for example, about the temperature, humidity or movement of certain objects. Due to the limited memory and and the high probability of failure, the nodes usually send collected data to a device (or device combination) called a sink or gateway, which is more reliable and has more power and memory available (depicted in Figure 7. 3). When a node is too far from the gateway, another node can forward the message to another node or to the sink. In certain use cases it is even feasible that a node processes the data (e. g. filtering out measurements that are not needed at the moment or computing an average value), in order to send less bytes or more useful data. The aggregators in Figure 7. 3 do exactly that, whereas the collectors only produce measurements. Because the nodes are constrained in resources, they require specialized tools, such as the operating system or protocols shown in the following sections (Akyildiz et al. 2002; Yick et al. 2008; Siffert 2018). As any protocol design is highly influenced by the hardware and operating system used, a brief overview for sTiki is presented in section 7. 4. 1. Some of the resources, especially memory, may already be consumed by existing application that need to be further supported by the new  add-on  protocol.",

B parts. The OpenMote-CC2538 mainly consists of the CC2538 processor from Texas Instruments, which has an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller with 512 kB storage and 32 kB RAM. It also has hardware implementations for AES-128 and AES-256. The OpenUSB has a USB port, space for two AA batteries and sensors for light, temperature, humidity, and acceleration on three axes (Tex 2012; Vilajosana et al. 2015; Sgier 2017; Siffert 2018).

Therefore, it is not possible to run Windows or Linux on them. As Contiki is used in this setup, it is briefly characterized here. Contiki is an open source minimal OS written in C, that was created by Adam Dunkels in 2004. It has a modular architecture which is built on top of an event-driven kernel (Dunkels et al. 2004). Whenever an event is triggered, it runs to completion, but can be preempted if necessary. To keep the size as small as possible, threads are only implemented as a library that is included when needed (Farooq and Kunz 2011). In the spirit of saving resources, Contiki offers no way to synchronize the internal clocks, which makes it impossible to implement a multitude of protocols. Contiki can dynamically load and unload code, which allows the running code to be changed remotely and without recompiling (Dunkels et al. 2004). As Contiki is extremely resource efficient, there are only two ways to start code execution: either code can run once the node has powered up, or in reaction to an event happening like a timer running out or a packet arriving. In general, this event-driven nature of Contiki has a big impact on the coding of applications. But here, the impact is limited due to the fact that an encryption protocol mostly works in response to the requests   encrypt or decrypt a message   of the application it supports. sTiki will secure the application s payload during transmission in the WSN. To understand the final design of sTiki it is essential to have basic knowledge of the important payload and its format.",

    "content": "sTiki will secure the application s payload during transmission in the WSN. To understand the final design of sTiki it is essential to have basic knowledge of the important payload and its format. Thus, a short description is presented here. The payload follows the TinyIPFIX format representing an adaptation of the IP monitoring protocol IPFIX (Schmitt et al. 2016, 2017). The concept of IPFIX became interesting for WSNs as it also applied a push concept of messages in pre-defined intervals. Another advantage is the splitting of measurement and meta data into two small messages   data records and template records   using IDs for cross-referencing and limiting the transmission number of template records, as they stay unchanged during operation. This design leads to a reduction of traffic in the network. Comparing TinyIPFIX to IPFIX further, it can be observed that TinyIPDIX omits a lot of information that is not used in most WSN contexts, thereby reducing the size of these packets. The implementation of the utilized TinyIPFIX also supports in-network data or message aggregation. Being able to aggregate the measurements is crucial to sending less data. This is important because sending data is one of the most power-intensive tasks a node can perform (Lowack 2013). Depending on the desired form of aggregation, it is possible to save a substantial amount of messages and energy by, for example, sending the average temperature of an entire room over two minutes instead of sending five nodes' measurements every ten seconds to a far away sink. If every measurement has to arrive at the sink, it is at least possible to perform message aggregation.",

If every measurement has to arrive at the sink, it is at least possible to perform message aggregation. Message aggregation works by combining multiple payloads into one, which works because TinyIPFIX has a constant overhead per message, regardless of payload size. Before implementing TinyIPFIX into an application it should be considered whether or not it actually makes sense to use TinyIPFIX. When it takes more power and time to aggregate the measurements than to simply forward them to the sink, then TinyIPFIX should only be deployed if network congestion is a bigger problem than the additional power requirements. Both forms of aggregation require that messages can be read by aggregators. If they cannot (i. e. due to encryption), aggregators are no longer able to take advantage of the aggregation. Being able to decrypt traffic on aggregator nodes is a key requirement for the encryption protocol discussed below. 7. 4. 2. Inspiring resource-efficient security protocols The three protocols TinySAM (Lowack 2013), MiniSec (Luk et al. 2007), and TinyDTLS (Kothmayr et al. 2013) inspired the sTiki protocol. sTiki relies heavily on TinySAM and uses similar methods and mechanisms and, thus, it is described in more detail compared to the other two protocols. TinySAM (Lowack 2013) is an application layer encryption protocol that uses any symmetric encryption (here and in Lowack (2013), AES128 is used) and a key server. There are multiple reasons for those choices. It is implemented as an application, running below other applications, because this makes it as platform independent as possible.",

The protocol would support asymmetric cryptography with only minor adjustments, but asymmetric cryptography uses significantly more RAM and ROM than symmetric cryptography (Hummen et al. 2014), even though it would offer more security (Mohd et al. 2015). Using a key server is a tradeoff solution. Having a single key for the entire WSN is very susceptible to node capture and can compromise the network in its entirety. Because of that, every link should be encrypted with its own key. But storing the keys for interacting with every other node requires a lot of ROM, renders key distribution extremely complicated, and makes adding new nodes to the network very expensive (Khan et al. 2012). Using a key server is not without problems either, because it forms a single point of failure and is thus a weak point (Bechkit et al. 2012), but in the planned use cases with a single sink node, the same problems exist, even if the key server was not used. Each TinySAM packet starts with a common header. The header may begin with a magic number, which serves to discriminate between packets that are encrypted with TinySAM from ones that are not. This is necessary in networks that have nodes that have no support for TinySAM. Also in the header is a number specifying the (TinySAMinternal) protocol (e. g. handshake, data transport, or alert) and subprotocol (i. e. what type of alert) a packet should be forwarded to.

Each node has a key it uses to communicate with and authenticate itself with the key server. To begin the handshake, Node A sends the first message M1 (containing IDA and a nonce NA) to B. B forwards this message, IDB and nonce NB to the key server in the second message, M2. If both nodes belong to the network and may communicate with each other, the key server generates a session key KAB. Then, the session key is encrypted once with A s initial key KAS and once with B s initial key KBS. Both versions are sent to B in M3, which decrypts the session key with its own initial key. To conclude the handshake, B sends M4 with the encrypted session key to A. By using B as an intermediate station to send the key to A, A only receives the session key after B has received the session key. This proves to A that the handshake was successfully completed and signals that buffered messages can be sent securely, using the just established session key.

When working with static keys, sending the same data twice results in the same (encrypted) message being sent twice. This allows attackers to draw conclusions from repetition patterns. To protect against such an attack, a counter mode is used for encryption with a changing initialization vector (IV), resulting in a new key for every message. Because sending data draws a lot of power, the whole initialization vector is not transmitted with every message. Instead, certain bytes of it act as a message counter and only this counter is sent along with the payload. This counter can also be used to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker captures a message and later sends it again. This will be detected because the counter is not increasing from one message to the next. To ensure the data (for example the message counter) has not been tampered with, a MAC is added to almost all of the messages. To calculate the MAC, the session key has to be known and changing only one bit will result in a completely different MAC, making tampered or incorrectly transmitted data easy to detect.",

    "content": "To calculate the MAC, the session key has to be known and changing only one bit will result in a completely different MAC, making tampered or incorrectly transmitted data easy to detect. The way TinySAM uses encryption results in all four properties being covered: using MACs produces authentication and data integrity, the counters offer freshness, and encrypting the data during transmission achieves confidentiality. TinySAM does not prescribe a specific cipher. With some minor modifications, even asymmetric ciphers would be feasible. In TinySAM, there are two common exceptional states. In the first case, a node has lost the initialization vector or has detected a packet with the wrong message counter. In that case, it instructs the other node to send a new initialization vector along with the next message. The other problem occurs when the session key was lost on a node, most likely because it lost power for a short amount of time, or because it crashed and had to reboot. If the node sending the message has lost the key, it will initiate a new handshake. The other node will simply overwrite the old session data. If the receiving node has lost the session key, it will relay the command to have the other node initiate a new handshake via the key server. This message is sent via the key server because the key server is the only node that has a key to communicate securely with the other node. If the instruction does not need to be secured, then a malicious node could permanently send  missing session' alerts in the name of any node in the network, shutting down any communication.

    "content": "MiniSec (Luk et al. 2007) is a security solution for WSNs with a version for unicasting and a version for broadcasting messages. Its main goal is low energy consumption, but with as little compromise in security as possible. In MiniSec, each node pair shares two encryption keys, one for each direction. This requires the network layout to be known in advance and does not allow new nodes to be added easily. The encryption is done with Skipjack in Offset CodeBook mode, which has the advantage of only requiring one pass over messages to produce the cipher text, as well as the integrity protection, thereby saving a lot of expensive encryption calculations. Message counters are included in the encryption keys to produce differing cipher texts, even when sending the same content repeatedly and to protect against replay attacks (Luk et al. 2007). MiniSec achieves all four security fundamentals listed in section 7. 3. 3. Confidentiality is provided by using encryption, authentication and data integrity are the result of integrity protection and freshness is achieved by using counters that alter encryption keys and initialization vectors. The main disadvantages of MiniSec are the pre-shared keys and its integration in the networking stack of the operating system. The pre-shared keys require a lot of planning before deployment and there is no easy way to switch out a single node in a network. The deep integration into the operating system makes it very convenient to use once it is set up, but the implementation is difficult and very hard to reuse in case it should be ported to a different operating system.

    "content": "TinyDTLS (Kothmayr et al. 2013) is an implementation of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol on TinyOS for OPAL nodes with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The DTLS protocol is an adaption of SSL TLS, altered to support unreliable communications, such as by UDP. In DTLS, the communication partners can authenticate each other, but do not have to. To do so, they present their X. 509 certificates to each other, which will be verified by the certificate authority. Authenticity, therefore, is voluntary, but can be forced by the application. Confidentiality is provided by encrypting the payload and integrity is guaranteed through the use of MACs (Kothmayr et al. 2013; Siffert 2018). The fact that DTLS is a standard protocol is a key advantage for interoperability with other systems. But this compatibility has a steep price: the overhead (compared to TinySAM (Lowack 2013) and MiniSec (Luk et al. 2007)) is large and messages are even padded, since DTLS only works with block ciphers. The code size and or hardware support are also expensive: the handshake uses RSA encryption, the payload encryption AES-128 and the MAC computation SHA1, and to securely store the certificate, a TPM is required. Implementing and performing three different ciphers is expensive for sensor nodes, which only makes DTLS useful for nodes with spare resources. Finally, introducing a certificate authority adds a single point of failure to the system, which can be a high risk when working in harsh environments or with a severely limited power supply. The cost of generating, storing and distributing the certificates should also not be disregarded. The implementation of TinyDTLS uses about 20 kB of RAM and 67 kB of ROM, which is about ten times the amount TinySAM uses (RAM and ROM), or four times the amount of ROM and 25 times the amount of RAM used by MiniSec (Luk et al.",

The sTiki protocol sTiki is designed in a similar way to TinySAM, which is an application layer encryption protocol using AES-128 for the symmetric encryption. As using a single key for the entire network deployment is very susceptible to node capture and can compromise the network in its entirety, a key server solution is combined with sTiki, and as a result, every link is encrypted with its own key. A drawback would be that storing keys for interactions with every node in the network would be memory consuming and make key distribution extremely complicated, especially when nodes are added to the network (Khan et al. 2012). Another drawback is that the key server solution would create a single point of failure in the network that is generally attractive for attackers (Bechkit et al. 2012). But this last drawback already exists, as in the existing network a single-point of failure is in place. This point is represented by the last node in the network, called a sink, which communicates with the server and together with it, represents the gateway (see Figure 7. 3).",

TelosB) may not have sufficient resources to encrypt data due to very limited resources and (b) a number specifying the sTiki-internal protocol (e. g. handshake, data transport, or alert) and sub-protocol (i. e. type of alert) used, a packet should be forwarded to.

For a color version of this figure, see www. iste. co. uk khatoun cybersecurity. zip In order to establish session keys, the ANOR (AN Otway-Rees) (Abadi and Needham 1994) protocol is used, where each node has a key it uses to communicate and authenticate itself with the key server (see Figure 7. 4). It is globally assumed that each participating node shares a unique key with the key server S in advance. From this key, two keys are derived during node startup (by encrypting separate hard-coded values), which are then used to communicate with the key server S. There is one key for computing the MAC, and another for message encryption. This shared key is called the initial master key (IMK) and, thus, S knows all IMKs of all nodes of the network, especially A s IMK, called KAS and B s IMK, called KBS.

By using B as an intermediate station to send the key to A, A only receives the session key after B has received the session key. This proves to A that the handshake was successfully completed and signals that buffered messages (e. g. template and data) can be sent securely, using the just established session key. As mentioned in Siffert (2018) using static keys to send the same data twice would result in the same encrypted message sent twice, allowing an attacker to draw a conclusion from repetition patterns. In order to overcome this problem, a counter mode is used for encryption with a changing initialization vector, resulting in a new key for each message (Lowack 2013). As sending large IVs would require a lot of space from the limited Message Transfer Unit (MTU) size, it was decided that only certain bytes of it acting as a Message Counter (MC) were sent along with the payload. This counter can also be used to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker captures a message and later sends it again. The reason for detection is that the counter is not increasing from one message to the next. To ensure that data has not been tampered with, a MAC (see Siffert (2018); Lowack (2013)) that was not mentioned in the handshake steps explicitly, is added to the messages. 7. 5. 1.

Second, AES-128 was chosen for encryption. Third, only one ongoing handshake per node is allowed at a time, but several keying materials can be stored, meaning that a node can have several links to neighboring nodes at the same time. Since each handshake takes up to 50 B plus the overhead of searching through them during handling, this consumes too many resources on constrained devices at a time. And finally, a failed handshake step will not be retried, meaning the handshake itself has to be initiated again. With this, blocking the activity of a node is avoided due to trying to resend a message. As the Contiki operating system is structured in a modular fashion, sTiki was also designed following this paradigm. Modules allow for a simple adaptation, if required, by switching out parts, such as the encryption algorithm, or making smaller changes for update purposes or extensions. A modular structure allows code to be kept local, simplifying maintenance and testing. Figure 7. 5 illustrates the modular architecture of sTiki, where the sTiki module is the starting point. As soon as messages are received, the sTiki module checks whether the message is in sTiki format. If not, it is responsible for redirecting messages to the appropriate protocol(s). Thus, the sTiki module functions as a dispatcher delegating the handling to respective modules. Thus, it checks for handshake messages or data messages, delegating them as required.",

These modules perform critical functions or carry state information used throughout sTiki and are integrated in most files in the implementation. The final implementation of sTiki consists of a node (see section 7. 5. 2. 1) and a key server part (see section 7. 5. 2. 2). Due to memory and power limitations, sTiki needs to be efficient here (Siffert 2018; Schmitt 2019): The limited RAM and ROM makes it necessary to keep in mind how much of these two resources is still available on the devices, as many decisions favor RAM, ROM or power savings at the cost of taking more of one or both of the other resources. For example, the fixed keys in each node: in sTiki, each node has a master key from which two keys are derived, in order to secure the communications with the key server. One is for encryption purposes, the other one is used to compute the MACs. It is possible to either store the master key in ROM and derive the two keys on startup, or precompute and store them in ROM so that the power to compute them can be saved on the expense of storing double the amount of keys. If the node has very little ROM left, it will probably be decided to spend the energy to recompute the keys. 7. 5. 2.",

It is responsible for the key creation and the handling of the deployment in order to ensure a secure data connection from node to gateway, respecting the encryption properties. 7. 5. 2. 1. sTiki s node implementation For the node implementation part, the main code is integrated in a file called stiki. h using four methods.

With these calls, the Handshake module resets the handshake status to IDLE, derives the keys for communicating with the server from the initial master key IMK and registers the connection the the key server S. Further, it is determined what should be done with incoming data, meaning which module they should be forwarded to. The stiki_udp_sendto(. . . ) method encrypts the data before sending it, otherwise for uncrypted communication, the stiki_udp_send_to(. . . ) method is selected. stiki_receive(. . . ) is the function to be registered as a callback when setting up connections that will be used to send data. The stiki-main. c and stiki-main. h files represent the core implementation of sTiki. Any action (e. g. sending, receiving) needs to pass through it. These two methods function as a dispatcher to the correct submodule (e. g. Datatransport module or Alert module).",

Some examples include searching for a session, checking if an active session to a specific node exists, updating timestamps for a session, or creating a session. Sessions can also be deleted, for example when the message counter rolls over, which forces a new session to be established because key or IV renegotiation logic was skipped in favour of a smaller implementation. A session requires 80 B storage and includes the following information (Siffert 2018; Schmitt 2019): node_id stores the partner node s ID. my_iv stores the IV used for messages sent to the partner node. remote_iv stores the IV received from the partner node. crypt_key stores the encryption key for messaged. mac_key stores the key used for MAC computation. last_event stores the last message s timestamp between the two nodes, which is used to determine a session timeout. The functions required for performing encryptions are integrated in the Encryption module. In the current implementation AES-128 is used, supported by the current version of Contiki. The encrypt_message function is responsible for encryption and decryption and requires a given key and the IV. The Encryption module itself applies bitwise XOR to the message for encryption.

Here, packet processing is done by stacking protocols on top of each other. Concretely, this means that when a packet is received it is parsed to the WSNProtocolPacket function and fed into the first protocol (here sTiki, see Listing 7. 1). The output is used as the input for the next protocol and so on, until the last protocol has done its job. A packet is not forwarded to the next protocol if the current protocol returns null. An example is a control message. As line 20 shows, processing in sTiki is done by using a function called process( ). It manipulates session information and packet content according to the sTiki protocol and returns a new packet with decrypted content if it was a  datatransport packet. In order to select the correct processing function, the correct subclass of STikiPacket( ) (see line 9) is determined by looking at the packet header when parsing the packet.",

It was recognized that this was the case for cryptographic functions and, thus, it was decided to locate the required classes in one package, called Crypto. It now includes the following classes: (1) AES. java, responsible for encrypting a single block with AES or an entire message in counter mode; (2) AES_CMAC. java, computing the checksum of messages or checking the MAC for correctness; (3) CryptoUtils. java, containing functions to generate random data, concerting byte arrays to strings and the other way around; (4) KeyStore. java, interacting with the file containing the initial keying material; (5) STikiUtils. java, containing functions converting IP addresses to node IDs and backwards, logging data and manipulating data (i. e. message header).

For the aggregator device, an additional 4, 556 B ROM and 368 B of RAM are required, compared to TinyIPFIX. The overhead is only caused by sTiki, the operating system s configuration stays the same as before. With this memory consumption measured, sTiki requires the OpenMote platform as a minimum, meaning it cannot run on TelosB. Thus, if a heterogenous network is in place, only parts of the communication can be secured with sTiki. Compared to TinySAM, sTiki is more memory efficient as only one handshake is allowed at a time. Savings in memory are also gained compared to MiniSec, but here especially in the time for encryptions, since MiniSec uses the Offset CodeBook mode to compute the ciphertext and the MAC in a single pass. Energy consumption measurements show that nodes in the standby-mode consume 29. 5 mA   1. 0 mA. When nodes send messages the current increases to 31. 5 mA   0. 2 mA. This was measured independent of the sTiki support as expected, because sending and computing data is the same process in both cases. Only the duration to perform the processes differed, due to MAC calculation, header creation, and session management. 7. 6. 1.

Debugging output for message M1 in CoMaDa (Siffert 2018) When the handshake is completed, the aggregator can send data. As no data was sent before, the first message includes an IV. Such a data message is illustrated in Figure 7. 9. Here, a message is shown, including an IV that is obvious as the header is EF21 (marked in red). The upcoming 13 bytes describe the IV and are marked blue, followed by the data itself. The last 16 bytes of the message marked in pink build the MAC. When this packet is received, the just-received IV and the session key are used to decrypt the data packet. Once an IV was set, the upcoming messages include a MC (marked in blue) only, saving 11 bytes per message. Such messages are than indicated with a header EF22 (marked in red), as shown in Figure 7. 10. Again, the MAC is marked in pink and represented by the last 16 bytes in the packet. Listing 7. 3 illustrates the respective debugging output from CoMaDa. In line 3, the header details are checked, followed by a check to see if an active link exists to the source node (lines 4 5) and if the MAC is valid (line 6).

As they do not have a shared session, the receiving node cannot do this in a secure manner. If the notification is possible in an unsecured manner, like sending a unsecured packet to initiate a new handshake, a DoS attack becomes possible by sending missing session packets to the complete network continuously. Thus, the message is relayed by the key server that can notify the sender node using its IMK to initiate a new handshake. In such a case, the key server recognizes the message as its header equals EF65. The packet includes the IDs of the involved nodes (e. g. BFBF and AEFD) protected by a MAC, which is computed with the IMK of the sender node. The key server constructs a message with header EF65, including the two node IDs to the destination node. The message is protected by the IMK of the destination node. The destination node is able to decrypt the packet. Based on the included information, the destination node initiates a new handshake with the respective node.

    "content": "When sending messages, the current increased to 31. 5 mA  0. 2 mA. This was the same on nodes with and without sTiki, which is to be expected because sending and computing data is the same process in both versions. The durations of those phases should be longer on the version with sTiki because the messages have some overhead because of the header and MAC, and the calculations should also take longer because the version with sTiki has to compute the MAC and manage sessions. On the nodes with sTiki the multimeter occasionally showed a lower current, flowing around 28 mA. It is unclear where this comes from, one possibility is that the hardware implementation of AES takes less power and the processor pauses calculations while the encryption is going on. However, the drops are not frequent enough to match with every encryption operation, but this may be caused by a low sampling rate of the multimeter, which misses short encryption sequences. By analyzing the binary file generated by the make command with the utility size, it is possible to find out the ROM and RAM requirements of the code running on the nodes. Table 7. 1 shows the measurements. It shows a RAM usage of 368 B (reported as data and bss) and a ROM usage of 4, 548 and 4, 556 B (reported as text) for sTiki. This difference in ROM usage most likely results from differing amounts of code that calls sTiki and or differing compiler optimizations. Listing 7. 4. XML example for sensors (Sgier 2017) 7. 6. 4.

Integration into an existing system In order to configure and manage the deployed network using Contiki, the server component shown in Figure 7. 3 was extended by the Contiki support including a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), called CoMaDa, offering Configuration, Management, and Data handling functionality for the deployed network. The GUI works according to the  click buttons  principle. CoMaDa itself offers a panel to view received data after the network was deployed, the tunnel was activated, and the virtual network interface was created. In order to decode the received packets correctly, CoMaDa requires an XML (eXtended Marup Language) file, where all parameters for each sensor are stored together with the mathematical equation to calculate the correct value. An example is shown in Listing 7. 4. A  field tag  is specified for each sensor of the device (e. g. lines 4 12 for a temperature sensor, lines 13  21 for a humidity sensor). The field tag for pull support is already included, but not yet activated in the implementation. Each enclosing field tag represents a Template Record from TinyIPFIX with additional information (Sgier 2017; Schmitt 2019): 1) name states the sensors name and indicates the sensor vendor (e. g. temperature (Sensiron SHT11)   line 5). 2) The fieldID and the enterpriseNumber are used to identify the data source uniquely (e. g. sensor from vendor X   lines 6 7). 3) type defines the type of the value measured (e. g. temperature   line 8). 4) unit defines the respective unit of the measured value (e. g.

The data is sent to WebMaDa s backend to store it in WebMaDa-DB and make it accessible via WebMaDa s front-end, as described in Schmitt (2019) for a live-stream with doa   1, meaning no aggregation is performed. As can be seen in Figure 7. 13, it is not visible in GUI CoMaDa if encrypted communication was activated or not. Thus, a proof of operability is performed by showing the captured messages in Wireshark, assuming the network setting shown in Figure 7. 7 and that the aggregator performs message aggregation with doa   2. Here, the aggregator waits until two messages are received from the collector with ID BFBF before it performs aggregation. 7. 6. 5. Comparison to existing approaches The implementation of TinySAM on TinyOS in (Lowack 2013) uses almost 6. 5 kB of ROM and about 1. 5 kB of RAM with similar configurations, which makes sTiki 2 kB smaller in ROM and 1. 1 kB smaller in RAM usage. The smaller size is mainly due to the limit of only one ongoing handshake at a time. Further reasons seem to point to the AES implementation, but such an evaluation was outside the scope of this work. In comparison to TinyDTLS, sTiki requires about 15 times less ROM and 50 times less RAM.",

Further reasons seem to point to the AES implementation, but such an evaluation was outside the scope of this work. In comparison to TinyDTLS, sTiki requires about 15 times less ROM and 50 times less RAM. This large difference was expected, because DTLS requires three different encryption algorithms. Just the binding to RSA takes about the same amount of ROM as the entirety of sTiki (Kothmayr et al. 2013). The price for using such a small implementation is its noncompliance with the standard DTLS, which might be more important in some use cases. sTiki s strength compared to MiniSec is size: it uses about half as much RAM and a little less than four times as much ROM as MiniSec uses. The important tradeoff during operation in comparison to MiniSec is in encryption speed, since MiniSec uses an Offset CodeBook mode to compute a ciphertext and MAC in a single pass. sTiki uses a separate algorithm for those two operations, thereby spending more time and energy to compute. Comparing the power consumption in detail with these measurements collected is not feasible, since precise timings are not available for the Contiki implementation. Figure 7. 13. CoMaDa s live stream showing the message aggregation 7. 7. Summary and conclusions This book chapter detailed insights about the measurable paradigm change of the initial Internet toward the IoT. Due to this situation and the rising awareness of personal data s misuse, security concerns have been identified. As it was depicted, reasons for delivering these security measures in the IoT occur due to (a) constrained device characteristics and (b) communication protocols used (e. g.

    "content": "As it was depicted, reasons for delivering these security measures in the IoT occur due to (a) constrained device characteristics and (b) communication protocols used (e. g. IEEE 802. 15. 4 or ZigBee). Thus, effective and efficient security protocols are demanded for IoT scenarios. sTiki was designed as such a security protocol to face the aforementioned challenges to overcome the security concerns mentioned. sTiki was designed in a modular and efficient manner, mapping the resources of constrained devices to possble functionality. As seen in these evaluations, secure communication can be established in a constrained network, however, it remains invisible for the user, when only viewing data received in graphical user interfaces, such as CoMaDa and WebMaDa. A key server implementation is resource consuming and not intended to be implemented on constrained devices itself, but with sTiki the key server is implemented on a resource-full instance of CoMaDa, following the delegation manner and, thus, management work is performed there instead of within the nodes. sTiki strengthens the constrained network deployed in its security: authentication and data integrity support is due to MAC usage, freshness support reached by counters and confidentiality via encryption using individual link-based session keys. Currently, symmetric encryption is used, but with a modification asymmetric encryption is feasible, too, if devices offer sufficient resources. Additionally, sTiki supports error recovery that can occur, (a) if a node has lost the initialization vector or has detected a packet with the wrong MC or (b) if a node has lost keying material, especially the session key. In the case of (a) the node causes the communication partner to send a new IV with the next message by sending a respective message.",

    "content": "In the case of (a) the node causes the communication partner to send a new IV with the next message by sending a respective message. In case (b) the node will relay a command to have the other node initiate a new handshake via the key server. This message is sent via the key server, because the key server is the only node that operates with a key to communicate securely with the other node. Overall, this chapter demonstrated that efficient security can be implemented in the IoT on constrained devices for smart home applications, collecting periodic data that addresses many security concerns from users. Furthermore, with sTiki s implementation and assuming OpenMote B as the node s platform, sufficient memory stays in place for further IoT applications on such constrained devices, such as data aggregation or collection. Due to the delegation of the main security operation of creating key material, the energy consumption for encrypting messages in the network is highly viable for IoT scenarios. In order to validate sTiki for industrial purposes, it is recommended to use an automated validation tool, such as Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). 7. 8.
