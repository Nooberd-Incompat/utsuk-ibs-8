ðŸ“‹ Question: what is web application security?
ðŸ¤– Answer: <think>
Okay, the user is asking about web application security. Let me look through the provided context again.

From Source 1, it mentions capturing security requirements to protect assets from threats like identity theft, financial fraud, SQL injection, and denial of service. It also talks about governance objectives and managing risks throughout the SDLC. 

Source 2 discusses how modern web apps have more valuable data, leading hackers to target logical vulnerabilities in code rather than server or network issues. It emphasizes collaboration between developers and security experts, and the importance of reconnaissance for mapping applications and identifying risks.

So, putting this together, web application security involves protecting apps from threats through security controls, governance, risk management, and collaborative practices like recon. Need to cite both sources where relevant.

Web application security refers to the protection of web applications from threats such as identity theft, financial fraud, exploitation of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection), and denial-of-service attacks [Source 1: Tony UcedaVelez, Marco M. Morana - Risk Centric Threat Modeling_ Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis-Wiley (2015).pdf, Chunk 584]. It involves implementing security controls to safeguard assets, managing risks throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and ensuring compliance with information security policies and regulations. Modern web applications are particularly vulnerable due to the increased value of data they handle (e.g., in banking, insurance, and healthcare) and the shift in hacker focus toward logical vulnerabilities in application code rather than server or network-level issues [Source 2: Web Application Security (1).pdf, Chunk 376]. Effective web application security requires collaboration between developers and security experts, as well as proactive measures like reconnaissance to map applications and identify architectural or logical risks.
