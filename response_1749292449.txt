ðŸ“‹ Question: How do mobile payment systems like QR-based apps ensure security in offline-first or low-connectivity areas?
ðŸ¤– Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention anything specific about QR-based mobile payment systems or their security measures in offline-first or low-connectivity areas. However, according to [Source 1: Georgios Kambourakis et al., Intrusion Detection and Prevention for Mobile Ecosystems-CRC Press (2017)], mobile devices are used extensively for sensitive tasks such as bank transactions and e-payments.

In general, to ensure security in offline-first or low-connectivity areas, mobile payment systems like QR-based apps can use various techniques, such as:

1. Tokenization: Instead of storing sensitive card information on the device, tokenized data is stored, and a unique token is used for transactions.
2. Offline transaction processing: Some mobile payment systems process transactions offline and then sync with the server once connectivity is available.
3. Biometric authentication: Mobile devices can use biometric authentication methods like fingerprint or facial recognition to secure transactions.
4. Secure communication protocols: Mobile payment systems can use secure communication protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data in transit.

However, these measures are not specific to QR-based apps and can be applied to various mobile payment systems.

It's worth noting that the provided context does mention the security of mobile devices and networks, but it does not specifically address mobile payment systems or their security measures in offline-first or low-connectivity areas.
