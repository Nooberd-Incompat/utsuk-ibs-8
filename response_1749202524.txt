ðŸ“‹ Question: how to prevent them?
ðŸ¤– Answer: <think>
Okay, the user is asking how to prevent web application attacks. Let me check the sources again.

Looking at Source 2, Chunk 138 mentions SQL injection defenses and code injection. It says that SQL injection is a subset of injection attacks and discusses defending against them in Part III. There's also mention of input sanitization and using APIs with proper validation. 

Source 1, Chunk 703 talks about implementing design changes and countermeasures like deploying APIs to filter malicious commands at different layers of the application architecture. It also mentions input filtering APIs that handle encoded versions of attack vectors.

So, the prevention methods include input validation and sanitization (like using APIs to filter malicious inputs), deploying security controls at multiple layers (e.g., NSAPI filters in DMZ and servlet filters internally), and implementing compensating controls as part of a risk management strategy. The answer should reference these points from both sources.

To prevent web application attacks, several strategies are recommended based on the provided context:  

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement APIs or security controls that filter malicious inputs, including encoded versions of attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection payloads). This ensures improper sanitization vulnerabilities are mitigated by restricting user input to expected parameters [Source 2: Web Application Security (1).pdf, Chunk 138].  

2. **Multi-Layer Defense**: Deploy countermeasures at multiple layers of the application architecture. For example, use NSAPI filters at the web server in the DMZ and servlet filters at the internal application server to block malicious commands effectively [Source 1: Tony UcedaVelez, Marco M. Morana - Risk Centric Threat Modeling_ Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis-Wiley (2015).pdf, Chunk 703].  

3. **Compensating Controls**: Adopt compensating controls to manage residual risks when direct remediation is not feasible, aligning with organizational risk mitigation strategies [Source 1: Tony UcedaVelez, Marco M. Morana - Risk Centric Threat Modeling_ Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis-Wiley (2015).pdf, Chunk 703].  

These measures address both technical vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection) and broader risk management frameworks.
