ü§ñ Answer: <think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to answer this question about NFC and its use in mobile payments based on the provided context. First, I need to recall what NFC is. The user wants an explanation of NFC and specifically how it's used in mobile payments.

Looking at the sources given, both are from the same book chapter by Michael Roland. Let me check Source 1 first. In Chunk 189, there's a mention that card emulation is a mode of NFC expected to have high commercial impact because an NFC device can interact with existing contactless smartcard readers as if it were a contactless smartcard. That seems relevant for mobile payments since credit cards and payment systems use this. It also says that NFC devices can operate as payment cards, loyalty coupons, or key cards in existing systems. So that's about using NFC in mobile payments by emulating smartcards.

Then there's Source 2, Chunk 73. Here, the focus is more on automotive uses of NFC, like connecting to car systems and replacing car keys. While this isn't directly about payments, it does mention secure elements and NFC's role in secure interactions, which might tie into security aspects of mobile payments. However, since the question is specifically about mobile payments, maybe the key info is from Source 1.

So putting that together: NFC allows a mobile device to act like a contactless smartcard, enabling it to interact with existing readers used by credit cards and payment systems. This means users can use their phones for payments instead of physical cards. The context also mentions secure elements storing credentials and performing cryptographic operations, which would be important for the security of mobile payments.

I need to make sure I'm not adding information beyond what's in the sources. There's no mention of how NFC works technically (like radio frequencies) but the question is about explanation and use in payments, which the sources cover. Also, note that the answer should cite the source where the info comes from. Since Source 1 talks about card emulation and payment use-cases, I should reference that.

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that enables short-range wireless communication between devices, allowing them to interact with existing contactless smartcard readers as if they were physical contactless smartcards [Source 1: Chunk 189]. In mobile payments, NFC devices can emulate payment cards, loyalty coupons, or access control keys by leveraging existing infrastructure for credit card terminals and micro-payment systems. This allows users to perform transactions securely using their NFC-enabled mobile phones instead of traditional plastic cards. The technology relies on secure elements within the device to store sensitive credentials and execute cryptographic operations, ensuring secure authentication and transaction processing [Source 1: Chunk 189].
